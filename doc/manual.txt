  1.  Introduction

  slrn (``S-Lang read news'') is a newsreader, i.e. a program that
  accesses a newsserver to read messages from the Internet News service
  (also known as ``Usenet''). It runs in console mode on various Unix-
  like systems (including Linux), 32-bit Windows, OS/2, BeOS and VMS.
  Beside the usual features of a newsreader, slrn supports scoring rules
  to highlight, sort or kill articles based on information from their
  header. It is highly customizable, allows free key-bindings and can
  easily be extended using the sophisticated S-Lang macro language.
  Offline reading is possible by using either slrnpull (shipped with
  slrn) or a local newsserver (like leafnode or INN).

  1.1.  Downloading slrn

  Directions for downloading the latest version of slrn are available
  from the slrn web site at <http://slrn.sourceforge.net/download.html>.

  If you are running Linux, slrn is probably included in your
  distribution.  However, please note that some distributors modify the
  sources; in this case, slrn might not always behave as it is described
  here.

  1.2.  Getting help

  First of all, please read the documentation found in this file and in
  the slrn FAQs at <http://slrn.sourceforge.net/docs/slrn-FAQ.html>.

  Questions not covered by the docs are on-topic in
  news.software.readers. If you speak German, you also might want to
  subscribe to de.comm.software.newsreader.

  slrn-user is a mailing list for discussion of the use, development and
  extension of slrn. You can subscribe to it through the web interface
  at <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/slrn-user>.

  To keep track of slrn's development, simply subscribe to slrn-
  announce.  It is a moderated list that informs you about new releases,
  important bugfixes or major changes to the website. The subscription
  address is <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/slrn-
  announce>.  All announcements are also mailed to slrn-user, so there
  is no need to read both lists.

  1.3.  About this manual

  This manual is the official reference for using and customizing the
  slrn newsreader. If you find that slrn behaves differently than
  described here, it means you found a bug (either in this manual or in
  slrn itself) and should report it.

  The manual is written in SGML using the ``linuxdoc'' DTD and has been
  ``rendered'' using the linuxdoc-tools package. The manual and other
  official documentation have their own web page at
  <http://slrn.sourceforge.net/documentation.html> where you can find
  these files in several different formats, as well as instructions on
  how to get the latest development version (which might be useful if
  you need documentation for a developer version of slrn).

  If you want to contribute to the manual (e.g. write additional
  chapters), please contact us, either privately or via the slrn-user
  mailing list at <http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/slrn-
  user>.  We also appreciate feedback about errors, bad language or
  suggestions concerning this manual.

  1.3.1.  History

  This manual was started by Matthias Friedrich and Thomas Schultz in
  1999 since there was no up-to-date end-user documentation available.
  As of version 0.9.7.0, it has been part of the official documentation.
  Since they first started it, the manual has undergone the following
  revisions:

     2008-07-04: Revision 2.7
        Updated the manual for changes in version 0.9.9.

     2004-10-04: Revision 2.6
        Added a brief introduction to the S-Lang prompt within slrn and
        updated the manual for version 0.9.8.1.

     2003-08-25: Revision 2.5
        Updated the manual for version 0.9.8.0.

     2002-04-31: Revision 2.4
        Added a section that describes the ``preprocessing'' facility
        and changed the manual's structure.

     2002-03-13: Revision 2.3
        Updated the manual for version 0.9.7.4.

     2001-11-05: Revision 2.2
        Updated the manual for version 0.9.7.3.

     2001-08-20: Revision 2.1
        Updated the manual for slrn 0.9.7.2; added a section about the
        functions of the ``readline'' interface.

     2001-06-06: Revision 2
        Added a section that describes all interactive functions and
        updated the manual for slrn 0.9.7.1.

     2001-03-28: Revision 1.1
        Manual updated to reflect the changes in slrn 0.9.7.0.

     2000-09-27: Revision 1
        First public release, explaining all slrnrc commands,
        configuration and environment variables and command line
        switches.

  2.  Configuration

  Basically, there are four ways to change slrn's behaviour:

  o  ``environment variables''

  o  ``a global configuration file''

  o  ``a personal configuration file''

  o  ``command line options''

  The list is sorted by priority - environment variables are overridden
  by settings in configuration files that are in turn overridden by
  command line options.

  Have a look at the following chapters for a detailed description of
  the above configuration facilities.

  Note: Please do not use options that are called ``obsolete'' in this
  manual. They are only included for backwards compatibility and will
  probably be removed before version 1.0 is released.

  2.1.  A brief introduction to the built-in S-Lang prompt

  When trying various configuration settings, you may find it quite
  inconvenient to constantly toggle between slrn and your editor and to
  restart slrn each time you made a change. Maybe you also want to play
  around with some settings without making (permanent) changes to your
  config file. In these cases, making yourself familiar with the built-
  in S-Lang prompt of slrn can be worthwhile.

  You get to the prompt by calling ``evaluate_cmd'' (by default bound to
  ``CTRL-X ESC'') in either group or article mode. You will notice that
  the bottom status line changes and displays S-Lang> - behind that
  prompt, you can enter your commands. Basically, you can do anything
  here that you could do in a macro, so if you want to explore the full
  capabilities of this prompt, you'll have to read the documentation
  that comes with S-Lang and look at the file slrnfuns.txt that comes
  with slrn.

  However, you can also do some simple things without understanding much
  about S-Lang:

  o  To find out the current value of a config variable, use a command
     like this one:

             message(string(get_variable_value("use_metamail")))

  After this, the current value of the variable will appear in the bot-
  tom status line. By the way, the call to string() is only needed when
  querying an integer variable, so you can omit it if you want when get-
  ting the value of a string variable.

  o  If you want to set a config variable at runtime, you need to know
     whether its type is integer or string (if in doubt, look it up in
     this manual). To set a variable, use something like

             set_integer_variable("use_metamail", 0)
               % for integer variables
             set_string_variable("metamail_command", "metamutt")
               % for string variables

  Note that changing a variable does not always have an immediate
  effect: For example, changing ``sorting_method'' does not automati-
  cally imply a re-sorting of the articles. By the way, you can call the
  intrinsic function sort_by_sorting_method from the S-Lang prompt
  afterwards in this specific case.

  o  You can also load macros dynamically using a line like

             () = evalfile("my-macro.sl")

  Note that you need those funny leading brackets and the equals sign in
  this case, because evalfile returns 1 on success. Using the given
  notation, we simply ignore the returned value. If we didn't do any-
  thing with it, it would be left on the stack and when this happens too
  often, you'll get a stack overflow at some point. If you really want
  to understand this, please read the file slang.txt that comes with the
  S-Lang documentation. Otherwise, simply use the notation given here.

  3.  Command line switches

  The following options can be used when calling slrn from the command
  line:

     -a Read active file when checking for new news. This can be
        permanently turned on by setting ``read_active'' to 1.
     -C Use colors without checking if the terminal supports it.

     -C-
        Don't use colors, even if the terminal supports it.

     -d Get group descriptions (taglines) from the news server. Please
        note that this may cause a download of several hundred kilobytes
        and thus can take a long time. The output is saved to a local
        file, so you only need to do this once. May not be specified in
        combination with ``--create''.

     -Dname
        Add name to the list of predefined preprocessing tokens, which
        can be used in your slrnrc file to have conditionally
        interpreted lines. For example, you can use the following slrnrc
        entry if you want to read mailing lists (stored as MH mail
        directories in /home/username/Mail/) with slrn -DMAIL:

                #ifdef MAIL
                  set spool_inn_root      "/home/username/Mail"
                  set spool_root          "/home/username/Mail"
                  set spool_nov_root      "/home/username/Mail"
                  set server_object       "spool"
                  set read_active         1
                  server "/home/username/Mail"  ".jnewsrc.mail"
                #endif

     Similarly, you can test if a given environment variable is set:

             #if$DISPLAY
               set editor_command "xjed '%s' -g %d -tmp"
             #endif

     -f file
        Use file as the newsrc file for this session. This is
        permanently set via the ``server'' configuration command.

     -h [snews://]host[:port]
        Connect to the NNTP server on host, overriding the $NNTPSERVER
        environment variable. If no port is given, the default NNTP port
        (119) will be used. The prefix snews:// indicates that slrn
        should attempt a secure connection. This will result in an error
        message when SSL support is not compiled in. Like -p, this
        option is only accepted after --nntp or when NNTP is the default
        mode.

     -i file
        Read file as the initialization (slrnrc) file. The default is to
        use .slrnrc (or slrn.rc on VMS, OS/2 and Windows) in your home
        directory.

     -k Don't read the ``score file''.

     -k0
        Read the score file, but inhibit ``expensive'' scoring. A
        scoring rule is ``expensive'' if it contains header lines that
        are not included in the server's overview files. This makes
        applying them slow.

     -n Do not check for new groups (usually resulting in a faster
        startup).  You can permanently set this via
        ``check_new_groups''.

     -m Force mouse support (without checking if it works on the current
        terminal). To permanently activate mouse support, you can use
        the ``mouse'' configuration variable.

     -p N
        Use port N to connect to the NNTP server.

     -w Wait for a key before switching to full screen mode. This is
        useful if you want to read the startup messages.

     -w0
        Like -w, but only waits if a warning or error message occurred
        on startup (e.g. an expired scorefile entry or a bogus group)

     --create
        Read the active file (the list of all groups) from the news
        server to create an initial newsrc file.

     --debug file
        Write debugging output to file. In NNTP mode, this logs the
        dialog with the server; the spool backend currently only uses
        this for error messages.

     --help
        Show help for command line switches.

     --inews
        Use an external ``inews program'' to post articles.

     --kill-log file
        Keep a log of all articles that were killed by the scorefile in
        file.

     --nntp
        Use builtin NNTP support for reading and posting (an external
        program is used to post if the ``force inews'' compile time
        option is set).

     --pull
        Spool outgoing articles locally for slrnpull to send.

     --show-config
        Print version, some compile time settings, internal variables
        after parsing the slrnrc, and environment variables used by
        slrn.

     --spool
        Read directly from spool.

     --version
        Print version and some compile time settings.

  4.  Environment variables

  This section contains a list of all environment variables that are
  relevant for slrn. Please note that environment variables have a low
  priority.  They can be overridden by both configuration file and
  command line switches.

     COLORTERM
        If this variable is set, slrn will assume that your terminal
        supports ``ANSI color sequences''. It also enables a workaround
        for a problem with the ``mouse reporting'' when running slrn
        inside of an rxvt.
     DISPLAY
        If set, slrn assumes that X11 is running and uses ``Xbrowser''
        when browsing a URL. Otherwise, ``non_Xbrowser'' is called.

     EDITOR
        See ``$SLRN_EDITOR''.

     HOME
        See ``$SLRNHOME''.

     HOSTNAME
        If no ``hostname'' is given, the value of this environment
        variable is used. As a last resort, slrn will call
        gethostname(3), gethostbyname(3) and getaddrinfo(3) (if
        available) to find a value it can work with. The hostname can
        also be hardcoded when building slrn (see OUR_HOSTNAME in
        slrnfeat.h). The value of OUR_HOSTNAME can either be the
        hostname as a string or the name of a file containing the
        hostname. Note that the environment variable overrides the
        hardcoded default and that the configuration variable overrides
        both.

     LOGNAME
        See ``$USER''.

     NAME
        If you did not set ``realname'', slrn tries to get a value from
        $NAME.  On Unix systems, it also queries the /etc/passwd gecos
        field.

     NNTPSERVER
        You can use this variable to tell slrn which NNTP server to
        connect to. It can be overridden by the command line option
        ``-h''. It is possible to compile in a default setting in case
        the user does not set $NNTPSERVER. This is done in slrnfeat.h by
        either setting NNTPSERVER_FILE to the name of a file containing
        the hostname or by directly setting NNTPSERVER_NAME to the
        hostname. In case both are defined, slrn first tries to read the
        file and only uses NNTPSERVER_NAME as a fallback.

     ORGANIZATION
        If ``organization'' is unset, the value of this variable is
        used. It overrides the compile time setting of OUR_ORGANIZATION
        (default is unset) in slrnfeat.h. Both the environment variable
        and the compile time default can optionally point to a file from
        which the organization line will be read.

     PRINTER
        On Unix systems, slrn pipes the current article to an external
        program in order to print it. If you do not specify the program
        using ``printer_name'', it uses ``lpr -P$PRINTER'' as the
        default.

     PWD
        This variable is only used on Unix systems that don't support
        getcwd(3). In these cases, it should be set to the current
        directory at the time slrn is invoked. This is usually nothing
        the user has to worry about.

     REPLYTO
        The value of this variable is used as the default if you do not
        set ``replyto'' in your slrnrc file.

     SLANG_EDITOR
        See ``$SLRN_EDITOR''.

     SLRNHELP
        The help window you get when hitting ``?''  inside slrn shows
        the default key bindings, which may or may not be the ones you
        are currently using. This is why slrn allows you to change the
        help text by creating a ``help file'' and letting $SLRNHELP
        point to it (the absolute filename is needed here). If $SLRNHELP
        is unset, slrn tries to read help.txt in the config directory.

        Your slrn distribution should include the file help.txt which
        you can copy and modify to suit your needs. It also serves as an
        example of the syntax of slrn help files.

     SLRNHOME
        When interpreting filenames as relative to your home directory,
        slrn uses this variable to find out what your home directory is.
        If $SLRNHOME is unset, $HOME is used instead.

     SLRNPULL_ROOT
        If you want to use slrnpull, you need to define a directory
        where it will look for its configuration files and spool the
        articles. An absolute filename is needed here. There is a
        compile time default for it in slrnfeat.h (SLRNPULL_ROOT_DIR,
        default: "/var/spool/news/slrnpull"), which can be overridden by
        the environment variable $SLRNPULL_ROOT. If an alternate root
        directory is given via the command line parameter ``-d'', it
        overrides both.

     SLRN_EDITOR
        If you did not define an editor in ``editor_command'' et al,
        slrn checks this variable. If it is unset, slrn subsequently
        looks at $SLANG_EDITOR, $EDITOR and $VISUAL. The last desperate
        call goes to edit (VMS and Windows), e (OS/2) or vi (Unix).

     SLRN_SLANG_DIR
        If set slrn will search for S-Lang macros here. If not set slrn
        will search in the default path, which is defined at compile
        time (usually <INSTALLPATH>/share/slrn/slang).

     TMP
        Indicates the directory in which slrn should save temporary
        files. If it is unset or does not contain an existing directory,
        $TMPDIR is tried. If both are unset, /tmp is used on UNIX
        systems, the current working directory on OS/2 and Windows and
        SYS$LOGIN: on VMS.

        An exception to this are temporary files created to invoke
        ``metamail''. In this case, $TMP is only queried on OS/2 and
        Windows NT.

     TMPDIR
        See ``$TMP''.

     USER
        If ``username'' is unset, slrn tries to get your login name from
        the system first. If this fails, it looks at $USER and $LOGNAME.

     VISUAL
        See ``$SLRN_EDITOR''.

  5.  The slrn configuration file

  5.1.  Basics

  Most customizations in slrn are done using an initialization file. If
  your administrator wanted to provide reasonable defaults for your
  system, he might have created a global configuration file. When
  reading such a file, slrn tells you its filename at startup (use
  ``slrn -w'' if you want to read the startup messages easily).

  The right place for your own settings is your personal configuration
  file, which by default is .slrnrc (or slrn.rc on VMS, OS/2 and
  Windows) in your home directory. It is possible to override settings
  from the global file here.

  An slrn configuration file consists of ``configuration commands'',
  each one on a line of its own. Most commands require arguments that
  can be either strings or integer values. If a string contains
  whitespace, you have to enclose it in double quotes (").

  The percent sign (%) is used as the comment character. From this
  character on, everything else on the same line will be ignored.
  Example:

          % Name of signature file to use
          set signature ".signature"

  If you set the same variable more than once in your configuration
  file, the last setting will take effect.

  The easiest way to build a personal configuration file is to make a
  copy of the annotated sample slrn.rc that is included in the slrn
  distribution and to tailor it to your needs.

  This manual contains a list of all ``configuration commands'' and
  ``variables''.

  5.2.  Preprocessing of configuration files

  slrn uses routines from libslang to parse its configuration files.
  Among other things, a simple preprocessing facility similar to cpp(1)
  is provided that makes it possible to use a number of conditions in
  your configuration files.

  Apart from minor syntactic differences, this is how they are used:

          #if...
            % Configuration commands to use if the condition is true.
          #elif...
            % ``else if''
            % Commands to use if the first condition is false but
            % the above condition is true.
          #else
            % Execute these commands if none of the above conditions
            % were true. This is the fallback case.
          #endif

  As usual, you can only use one ``#if'' condition, any number of
  ``#elif'' conditions (including none) and up to one ``#else'' state-
  ment. If the ``#endif'' statement is missing, everything up to the end
  of the file is included.

  Conditions may be nested, but you may not use whitespace in front of
  the ``#'' characters. However, whitespace may be used freely after the
  leading ``#'' which is useful for indenting.

  5.2.1.  #iffalse, #ifntrue

  The equivalent of ``#if 0'' in cpp(1) which always returns false.
  This can be used to deactivate a part of your configuration without
  having to set a comment character (``%'') in front of each line.

  Example:

          #iffalse
            This code will never
            be included in your
            configuration file.
          #endif

  5.2.2.  #iftrue, #ifnfalse

  The inverse of ``iffalse''. This condition is always true which means
  that configuration commands in this block will always be executed.

  5.2.3.  #if$ENV

  This condition is true if the environment variable $ENV is set.

  Example:

          #if$DISPLAY
            % The environment variable DISPLAY is set, so we assume
            % that X is running and use an editor with GUI.
            set editor_command "gvim +%d %s"
          #else
            % DISPLAY is unset, so we fall back to a textmode editor
            set editor_command "vi +%d %s"
          #endif

  5.2.4.  #ifn$ENV

  This condition is true if the environment variable ENV is not set.

  5.2.5.  #if$ENV string1 string2 ...

  The condition is true if the contents of the environment variable ENV
  are equal to at least one of its argument strings. The arguments have
  to be separated using whitespace. There is no quoting mechanism for
  space or tabulator characters.

  Example:

          #if$TERM rxvt
            % In my rxvt, ``default'' is a light background;
            % ``color15'' is re-defined as a dark shade of blue.
            color normal    "black"         "default"
            color headers   "color15"       "default"
            color thread_number     "blue"  "default"
            % [...] More color settings follow
          #elif$TERM linux wsvt*
            % On the Linux or NetBSD console, I prefer a black background
            % to reduce flickering:
            color normal    "lightgray"     "black"
            color headers   "brightblue"    "black"
            color thread_number     "brown" "black"
            % [...] More color settings follow
          #endif

  The strings may contain wildcard characters. The ``?'' character
  matches an arbitrary single character and ``*'' matches any number of
  characters (including none). To use them literally, you have to escape
  them with a backslash (``\*'' and ``\?''). The backslash itself also
  has to be escaped when used literally (``\\'').

  5.2.6.  #ifn$ENV string1 string2 ...

  The condition is true if the contents of the environment variable ENV
  are equal to none of its argument strings. The arguments have to be
  separated using whitespace. There is no quoting mechanism for space or
  tabulator characters.

  As with ``#if$ENV'', wildcards can be used.

  5.2.7.  #ifdef SYMBOL1 SYMBOL1

  This condition is true if any of its arguments is a defined
  preprocessor symbol. You can define symbol using the ``-D'' command
  line switch.

  Depending on the operating system, one of the following symbols is
  defined: ``UNIX'', ``WIN32'', ``NT'', ``VMS'', ``OS2''.

  Example:

          #ifdef UNIX
            % On Unix, printer_name is the command to use for printing
            set printer_name "lpr -Pmy_printer"
          #elifdef WIN32
            % On Win32, printer_name is set to the print queue
            set printer_name "MyPrinter"
          #endif

  5.2.8.  #ifndef SYMBOL1 SYMBOL2 ...

  This condition is true if none of its arguments is a defined
  preprocessor symbol.

  5.3.  Configuration commands

  5.3.1.  autobaud

  Usage: autobaud
  Default: off

  The autobaud command may be used to synchronize the output rate slrn
  uses to the terminal baud rate.

  5.3.2.  charset

  Usage: charset option charset

  option can be one of these:

     display
        slrn will use this character set when displaying articles.

        Default: detected from locale settings if supported by OS.
        (autodetection not supported in (cyg)win)

     outgoing
        This setting will be used for the charset encoding of outgoing
        articles and emails. Setting a value like "iso-8859-15,utf-8" is
        possible; slrn will try the settings from left to right and use
        the first for which encoding succeeds.

     config
        Set this value if your .slrnrc contains non-ascii characters.

        Default: us-ascii

     editor
        Set this value if the encoding your editor uses is different
        from the locale setting.

        Default: value from charset display

  5.3.3.  color

  Usage: color display_element foreground background [attributes]

  If your terminal supports ANSI color sequences, you can use the color
  command to define your own color scheme. You can assign a different
  color to almost every element on your screen.

  display_element can be one of these:

     article
        Regular text in the article body.

     author
        The author's name / email address in header overview.

     boldtext
        Text in the article body that is interpreted as *bold*.

     box
        Text inside of selection boxes (like the one you see when
        choosing a sorting mode).

     cursor
        The cursor you see in the group window and in header overview.

     date

        The header number in header overview.

     headers
        The content of header lines in the pager.

     high_score
        The exclamation mark (``!'') used to denote ``high scoring''
        articles in header overview.

     italicstext
        Text in the article body that is interpreted as /italic/.

     menu
        The first line of your display. If ``mouse reporting'' is turned
        on, it contains a menu.

     menu_press
        A menu item while you click on it.

     message
        The messages and prompts in the bottom line of the screen.

     neg_score
        The subject / score of articles with a negative score value,
        depending on the setting of ``color_by_score''.

     normal
        Everything that does not have its own color object.

     pos_score
        The subject / score of articles with a positive score value,
        depending on the setting of ``color_by_score''.

     pgpsignature
        ``PGP signatures'' appended to the article body.

     quotes
        ``Quoted text'' in the article body.  It is now possible to
        distinguish up to 8 levels of quoted material by using color
        objects ``quotes0'' to ``quotes7''.

     response_char
        The highlighted character you need to press if you want to make
        a selection (e.g. in ``[Y]es or [N]o?'').

     selection
        The ``cursor'' used in selection boxes (see also: ``box'').

     signature
        ``Signatures'' appended to the article body.

     subject
        The subject in header overview (see also: ``unread_subject'').

     thread_number
        The number of articles in the thread (displayed in header
        overview next to collapsed threads).

     tilde
        The ``tilde'' displayed at the end of the article body.

     tree
        The thread tree drawn in the header overview.

     underlinetext
        Text in the article body that is interpreted as _underlined_.

     unread_subject
        Color for unread subjects. Please see the entry on
        ``highlight_unread_subjects'' for details.

     url
        Used to ``highlight URLs'' in the article body.

     verbatim
        Text in the article body enclosed by ``verbatim marks''.

  The foreground and background colors have to be set to one of the
  following strings:

          black      gray
          red        brightred
          green      brightgreen
          brown      yellow
          blue       brightblue
          magenta    brightmagenta
          cyan       brightcyan
          lightgray  white

  Additionally, you can use the default foreground / background colors
  of your terminal via the keyword ``default''.

  Please note that the colors in the right column are all ``bright'' (or
  ``bold''). On many terminals, they can only be used for the
  foreground. If you think your terminal has more than 8 background
  colors, but slrn refuses to use them, you might need to chose a
  different terminfo entry. On modern xterms and rxvt, setting $TERM to
  xterm-16color should work.

  Some terminals support more than 16 colors, and slrn can then use 256
  colors when compiled against slang-2. The additional values for
  foreground and background colors are specified as colorN, where N is a
  decimal number from 0 to 256. In this case, $TERM may need to be set
  to xterm-256color.

  After the color settings, you can optionally use attributes (like
  underline and bold) the same way you would specify them using the
  ``mono'' command (see there for details).

  A sample color scheme (which simply sets the colors to their compile
  time default) can be found in the slrn.rc file that should have come
  with your slrn distribution.

  5.3.4.  compatible_charsets

  This command is obsolete, use ``charset'' instead.

  5.3.5.  group_display_format

  Usage: group_display_format number format-string

  This command allows you to change the way the groups are presented to
  you in the group window. You can save up to 10 different formats and
  switch among them using ``toggle_group_formats'' (default binding: ESC
  a).
  The default settings are:

          group_display_format 0 "  %F%-5u  %n%45g%d"
          group_display_format 1 "  %F%-5u  %n%50g%-8l-%h"
          group_display_format 2 "  %F%-5u [%-6t]  %n"

  number is the number of the format (0-9).

  The following % escapes can be used:

          F  Group flag (`U' for unsubscribed, `N' for new)
          d  Group description (needs to be downloaded once with slrn -d)
          h  ``High water mark'' (highest article number in the group)
          l  ``Low water mark'' (lowest article number in the group)
          n  Group name
          t  Total number of articles in the group (estimate)
          u  Number of unread articles in the group

  The special descriptors ``%g'' and ``%?'' work like in
  ``header_display_format''.

  5.3.6.  grouplens_add

  Usage: grouplens_add newsgroup

  Add newsgroup to the list of groups for which you want to download
  GroupLens scores.

  5.3.7.  header_display_format

  Usage: header_display_format number format-string

  This command can be used to customize the way article headers are
  presented in the header overview in article mode. You can specify up
  to 10 different formats and switch among them using
  ``toggle_header_formats'' (default binding: ESC a). This command may
  also be used with a prefix argument to select a particular format,
  e.g., ESC 0 ESC a will select the 0th format.

  Here are slrn's default settings:

          header_display_format 0 "%F%B%-5S%G%-5l:[%12r]%t%s"
          header_display_format 1 "%F%B%G%-5l:[%12r]%t%s"
          header_display_format 2 "%F%B%-5l:%t%s"
          header_display_format 3 "%F%B%-5S%-5l:%t%50s %r"
          header_display_format 4 "%F%B%-5S [%10r]:%t%49s %-19g[%17d]"

  number is the number of the format (0-9).

  format-string is a string containing printf(3) style % escapes. This
  is the generic format:

          %[[-*]w]x

  The brackets indicate optional items: w may consist of one or more
  digits and specifies the width of the field. In fields with a fixed
  width, the minus sign (-) can be used to right justify an item, the
  asterisk (*) to center justify it. Please note that these modifiers
  have no effect if the text does not fit into the field.

  The item specifier (x) is required and, depending on its value, has
  the following meaning:

           %  percent character
           B  body status for true offline reading: 'H' means no body
              (header only), 'M' means body is marked for download
           C  prints `C' if current thread is collapsed
           D  date (as defined by overview_date_format)
           F  flags (read/unread, `*' and `#' tags, header number)
           G  GroupLens score
           P  prints `P' if current article has a parent (inside threads)
           S  score
           T  thread tree
           b  article size (usually in kilobyte)
           c  number of messages in current subthread
           d  date
           f  from header
           l  article length (number of lines)
           n  server number
           r  author's real name
           s  subject
           t  number of messages in thread plus tree

  Additionally, the special format descriptor %Xg can be used. It is not
  substituted by text, but specifies that the next write on the screen
  should take place in column X (numbered from 0). If X is negative, the
  cursor is placed X columns from the right edge of the window.

  Thus, "%F%-5l:%t%s%-20g %r" indicates that the header window will
  contain (in that order): the flags, the number of lines the article
  contains (right justified in a 5 character field), a `:', the tree,
  the subject, and, beginning 20 columns from the right edge of the
  window and separated by a blank, the author's real name.

  A %? construct can be used to print a string only if one of the above
  descriptors expands to a non-zero string (i.e. one that is not empty
  and does not contain only a single whitespace or the number `0'). It
  has the following syntax:

          %?<descriptor>?<optional string>?
          %?<descriptor>?<string if true>&<string if false>?

  You can use escape sequences in optional strings; however, it is not
  possible to nest them, nor to have literal `?' or `&' characters in
  them.

  Example: If you want to display the number of messages for collapsed
  threads and the number of lines in the message otherwise, you can use
  the following:

          %?C?%-3c&%-3l?

  Note: The descriptor %b automatically choses a ``unit'' (bytes /
  kilobytes / megabytes) and works best when given four characters of
  space, i.e. %-4b. The descriptors %t and %T write directly to the
  screen, so they cannot be ``tested'' with the %?  operator and ignore
  the requested field width (i.e. ``%10t'' is the same as ``%t''; the
  ``10'' is ignored). The descriptor %t is included for backwards
  compatibility and equivalent to ``%?C?%-3c&   ? %T''.

  See also: ``group_display_format'', ``overview_date_format''

  5.3.8.  ignore_quotes

  Usage: ignore_quotes pattern [pattern] ...

  The regular expressions given here are used to determine quoted lines
  in the body of an article. You can define up to 5 different patterns
  (this is meant to make up for the lack of an OR operator in S-Lang
  regexps). Please try to keep them as exact as possible, so that slrn
  is able to distinguish different quoting levels - e.g. use ``^>''
  rather than ``^>*''.

  By default, only one pattern is set: ``^ ? ?[><:=|]''

  5.3.9.  include

  Usage: include filename

  You can use this command to load an additional file that contains
  configuration commands. With this feature, you can easily keep startup
  files for different key bindings, colors etc. filename is relative to
  your home directory (see ``$SLRNHOME''). This can safely be done
  multiple times and recursively.

  Example:

          include ".slrnrc-colors"

  5.3.10.  interpret

  Usage: interpret filename

  This command loads and executes an S-Lang macro file. filename may be
  an absolute or relative path. Relative paths are resolved by checking
  first your ``macro_directory'' if set, then $SLRNHOME if set, then
  $HOME, and finally the default directory set at compile-time for the
  macros included with slrn.

  This command has no effect if the S-Lang interpreter has been
  deactivated at compile time.

  5.3.11.  mono

  Usage: mono display_element attributes

  You can use this command to customize slrn's appearence on monochrome
  displays. See section ``color'' for a description of display_element.
  attributes can be one of

  o  bold

  o  blink

  o  underline

  o  reverse

  or ``none'' to turn off video attributes. The attributes can also be
  combined (simply separate them with blanks). You can find sample
  settings in the slrn.rc file that should have come with your slrn
  distribution.

  If you don't like blinking, you can turn it off altogether via
  ``use_blink''. If you run slrn with colors, these settings will not
  have any effect.

  5.3.12.  nnrpaccess

  Usage: nnrpaccess host[:port] username password

  This command can be used to set the necessary data for servers that
  request NNRP authentification. host is the full hostname of the
  server.

  If you do not feel comfortable with leaving your password written on
  disk, you might want to set the password (and optionally the username
  as well) to an empty string (""). slrn will then prompt for it on
  startup. If your server requires a username, but no password, set it
  to a blank (" ") and you won't be prompted.

  5.3.13.  posting_host

  Usage: posting_host hostname

  The hostname specified in this command will be used to generate
  Message-IDs.  Please note that it is usually not necessary to set this
  manually, as slrn uses the fully-qualified domain name of the machine
  it is running on for this task, which is the correct solution in most
  cases.

  However, if your system is part of a local network, it might not have
  an official hostname. As the current MESSFOR draft permits the use of
  hostnames without a DNS record for Message-ID generation, some
  providers started to give each user a unique hostname that may be used
  here.

  Note: Do not use this command unless you fully understand the
  implications. Specifically, do not enter an arbitrary string here!
  Instead, please turn off ``generate_message_id'' if the hostname found
  by slrn is not unique.

  5.3.14.  server

  Usage: server nntp-server[:port] newsrc-file

  By default, slrn uses .jnewsrc in your home directory (jnews.rc on
  VMS, OS/2 and Windows) as its newsrc file. If you want to define a
  different filename for it or if you want to access more than one
  server, you can use this command. It tells slrn to use newsrc-file
  when connecting to nntp-server (which has to be the full hostname of
  the server and an optional port number or, if you are reading from
  spool, the path of the spool directory).

  If your server requires a password, you will also need to use the
  ``nnrpaccess'' command.

  5.3.15.  set

  Usage: set varname value

  The set command is used to assign values to the ``configuration
  variables'' described below. varname has to be a valid variable name.
  value is either a string (best enclosed in double quotes ``"'') or an
  integer value (number), depending on the variable.

  Example:

          set realname "Matthias Friedrich"
          set kill_score -9999

  Note: If you set a variable which controls a feature that has not been
  compiled in, slrn will not give you an error message. The setting will
  simply remain without an effect.

  5.3.16.  setkey

  Usage: setkey keymap function key-sequence

  This command allows you to map slrn's functions to keys. There are
  three different keymaps: The ``group'' keymap contains all functions
  in group mode, ``article'' contains the functions in article mode
  (note that header overview and pager do not have separate keymaps);
  finally, the ``readline'' keymap can be used to customize the line
  editor.

  function specifies the function that is executed when key-sequence is
  pressed. In key-sequence, special keys can be addressed in different
  ways. First of all, the control key plus a character C is written as
  ^C.

  The special function keys found on most keyboards have the following
  (case insensitive) names:

          <PageUp>
          <PageDown>
          <Up>
          <Down>
          <Right>
          <Left>
          <Delete>
          <BackSpace>
          <Insert>
          <Home>
          <End>
          <Enter>
          <Return>
          <Tab>
          <BackTab>
          <Space>
          <Esc>

  Additionally, the keys <F1> through <F20> denote the function keys.
  When you use these symbolic names, slrn uses the terminfo database (if
  available) to look up the key sequences generated be those keys, so if
  these names do not seem to work, make sure you selected the correct
  terminal (e.g. via the $TERM environment variable).

  Alternatively, you can specify special keys by entering the key
  sequence they generate directly. To do this, the following shortcuts
  may be useful:

          \e    escape
          \r    return
          \\    backslash
          \NNN  the key sending keycode (octal) NNN

  A full list of available functions can be found in sections ``group
  functions'' and ``article functions''.

  5.3.17.  strip_re_regexp

  Usage: strip_re_regexp pattern [pattern] ...

  Here, you can define up to 5 different regular expressions to detect
  non-standard back references created by broken user agents. They will
  be stripped on followups.

  By default, slrn only checks for the standard ``Re:''. This test is
  performed before strip_re_regexp is even tried and it cannot be turned
  off.

  Note: This variable does not affect the way slrn sorts subjects. For
  example, ``subject'' and ``Re: subject'' are equivalent when sorting;
  ``subject'' and ``AW: subject'' are not, even if you defined ``^AW:''
  in strip_re_regexp. The reason for this is that it would be too
  expensive to do a full regexp search whenever comparing subjects.

  5.3.18.  strip_sig_regexp

  Usage: strip_sig_regexp pattern [pattern] ...

  slrn itself makes sure that you use the signature delimiter that
  current drafts prescribe (``-- '' - mind the trailing space!).  If you
  want it to recognize different delimiters as well (e.g. ones created
  by broken software), you can use this command to define (up to five)
  regular expressions that match them.

  5.3.19.  strip_was_regexp

  Usage: strip_was_regexp pattern [pattern] ...

  When changing the ``Subject:'' header line, some people follow a
  convention and include the old subject in brackets (e.g. ``new subject
  (was: old subject)''). You can use this command to strip the old
  subject automatically on followups and when creating scorefile entries
  based on the subject (so it will still match when the old subject is
  stripped). To do this, I recommend the setting `` ?(was:.*)$''.

  Note: This variable does not affect sorting. See ``strip_re_regexp''
  for an explanation.

  5.3.20.  unsetkey

  Usage: unsetkey keymap key-sequence

  The unsetkey command undoes a key binding. Please see ``setkey'' for
  more information.

  Example:

          unsetkey group "\e"

  5.3.21.  visible_headers

  Usage: visible_headers header_lines

  With this command, you can specify a comma-separated list of
  header_lines that should still be visible in the article pager when
  the display of all headers is turned off (this is toggled via
  ``toggle_headers'', by default bound to `t').
  Note that the strings are not regular expressions. However, substrings
  can be used; e.g. ``X-'' matches all headers beginning with ``X-''.
  It's also possible to exclude certain headers by preceding them with a
  bang (`!'). If multiple entries match, the last one decides whether or
  not the header is displayed, so ``X-,!X-Trace:'' shows all X-headers
  except ``X-Trace:''.

  Headers mentioned in visible_headers that don't occur in the article
  are silently ignored.

  Example:

          visible_headers "From:,Subject:,Newsgroups:,Followup-To:,Reply-To:"

  6.  Configuration variables

  The following variables can be set using the ``set'' configuration
  command:

  6.1.  abort_unmodified_edits

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, slrn aborts posting or email operations if the user did
  not modify the article.

  See also: ``editor_command'', ``post_editor_command'',
  ``mail_editor_command''

  6.2.  art_help_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This string is displayed in the bottom line while you are reading an
  article. It is intended as a quick help when you cannot remember what
  key to press ;-) If unset, the following line is used (localized):

  SPC:Pgdn  B:PgUp  u:Un-Mark-as-Read  f:Followup  n:Next  p:Prev  q:Quit

  See also: ``group_help_line'', ``header_help_line''

  6.3.  art_status_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable can be used to customize the status line of the article
  pager.  It accepts all % escapes that work for
  ``header_display_format'' plus the ones listed here:

          H  Prints `H' unless headers are hidden
          I  Prints `P' unless PGP signatures are hidden
          L  Current line (e.g. "1/18")
          P  Percentage of the way through the article
          Q  Prints `Q' unless quotes are hidden
          T  Prints `S' unless signatures are hidden
          V  Prints `V' unless verbatim text is hidden
          W  Prints `W' if wrapping is enabled
          p  Prints `<' if the window is panned (scrolled horizontally)
          v  Prints `v' unless verbatim marks are hidden

  When unset, slrn uses "%p%n : %s %-20g -- %L (%P)" (localized).

  See also: ``group_status_line'', ``header_status_line'',
  ``top_status_line''

  6.4.  auto_mark_article_as_read

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, every article you open will automatically be marked as
  read.

  6.5.  beep

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  This variable controls how slrn tries to get your attention.

          0  do not beep
          1  send audible bell
          2  send visible bell
          3  send both visible and audible bell

  6.6.  broken_xref

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  When you set this variable to a non-zero value, slrn requests articles
  by Message-ID instead of header number. This provides support for
  servers with broken "Xref:" headers and should otherwise be left
  untouched.

  6.7.  cansecret_file

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  If you want slrn to put cancel-locks into the articles you post, set
  this variable to a file that contains the secret (the password, which
  you can chose arbitrarily) you want to use to generate them.

  Cancel-locks are a way of making sure that nobody else but you can
  cancel or supersede your articles (as long as he does not have your
  password, so keep it to yourself). Please note that this feature needs
  to be enabled at compile time (it requires the additional library
  canlock) and that cancel locks only have an effect if the server
  supports them.

  6.8.  cc_followup

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  This variable controls whether slrn sends email copies ("courtesy
  copies") of followups:

          0  Never send email copies automatically
          1  Prompt if original poster requested a copy
          2  Send email copy if original poster requested it
          3  Always prompt
          4  Send copy if poster requested it; prompt otherwise

  The original poster can indicate that he wishes to receive an email
  copy by adding an "(X-)Mail-Copies-To:" header line to his posting. If
  it contains the keyword "nobody" ("never" is not covered by current
  drafts, but also accepted), the poster does not want any email copies.
  slrn will not prompt you in that case.

  When using settings three or four, please keep in mind that many
  people on usenet consider "courtesy copies" to be impolite because
  they do not want to read the same message both in their private email
  and in a newsgroup.

  See Also: ``cc_post_string''

  6.9.  cc_post_string

  Type: string
  Default: "[This message has also been posted to %n.]" (localized)

  This string will be included in the mail copies of any article you
  send. However, it won't be displayed in the editor and will not be
  included in the posting sent to the newsgroup.

  The variable may contain the sequence %n, which will be replaced by
  the newsgroup(s) the article was posted to. If you need a "verbatim" %
  character, use %%.

  Note: cc_followup_string used to support all % sequences defined by
  ``followup_string''. This has been changed, as it could lead to wrong
  data getting inserted in some cases. If you miss a special sequence,
  please report it as a feature request.

  See Also: ``cc_followup''

  6.10.  charset

  This variable is obsolete, use ``charset'' instead.

  6.11.  check_new_groups

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If you do not want to check for new groups on startup and when doing a
  ``group refresh'' (by default bound to `G'), you can set this variable
  to 0. This has the same effect as using the command-line parameter -n.

  6.12.  color_by_score

  Type: integer
  Default: 3
  Determines whether or not color should be used to indicate the score
  of an article. The following settings are possible:

          0  scores do not influence colors
          1  scores are colored by their value
          2  subjects are colored by score
          3  both scores and subjects are colored by score

  If this feature is enabled, slrn uses the color objects neg_score,
  pos_score and high_score when printing the score / subject of articles
  with a non-zero score value.

  6.13.  confirm_actions

  Type: integer
  Default: 31

  This variable decides in which situations slrn will ask you to confirm
  an action. It has a bitmapped value which can be the sum of any
  combination of the following numbers:

          1   Confirm marking groups as read or un-read.
          2   Confirm printing an article.
          4   Confirm posts, followups, replies and supersedes.
          8   Confirm leaving a group by following a news: URL.
          16  Confirm quitting slrn.

  Thus, the default means that the user is always asked for
  confirmation.

  6.14.  custom_headers

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Use this variable to create additional header lines when posting to a
  newsgroup. Note that they will only be added to articles you wrote
  using ``post'' (by default bound to `P'). If you want to have
  additional headers in followups, you need to set them in
  ``followup_custom_headers'' instead; headers in supersedes are set
  with ``supersedes_custom_headers''. The header lines you add this way
  will also show up in your editor so you can modify them.

  Although this variable currently does not support any % escapes, you
  need to double any % signs you may want to use inside it. This is
  because all other *_custom_headers variables do support % escapes and
  people who used the same values (mostly X-Faces) in all cases
  frequently were surprised at the different results.

  Note: It is generally not possible to override existing headers using
  custom_headers. An exception to this rule is the "Message-ID:" header
  line which can optionally be set by using this variable. However,
  there is usually no need to do this as slrn has an excellent algorithm
  for creating Message-IDs itself. Let me repeat this: Only override the
  "Message-ID:" header if you know exactly what you are doing. When
  doing this, it's essential that you know (and, of course, follow) the
  RFCs and the rules of your ISP.

  Example:

          set custom_headers "X-URL: http://foo.com\nX-No-Archive: yes"

  See also: ``reply_custom_headers''

  6.15.  custom_sort_by_threads

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If ``sorting_method'' is set to 12 (custom sorting), this variable is
  used to decide whether or not to thread headers. In this case, any
  non-zero value activates threading.

  See also: ``custom_sort_order''

  6.16.  custom_sort_order

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  If custom sorting is enabled by setting ``sorting_method'' to 12, this
  variable defines the sort order you want to use. It is a comma-
  separated list of the following keywords:

          author     Sort alphabetically (A-z) by realname
          body       Sort articles without body first (true offline mode)
          date       Sort by date, oldest first
          highscore  Sort high scoring articles, those without high scores first
          id         Sort alphabetically (A-z) by Message-ID
          lines      Sort by number of article lines, lowest number first
          number     Sort by server number, lowest first
          score      Sort by score, lower numbers first
          subject    Sort alphabetically (a-z) by subject, ignoring case

  As you can see, all keywords use an ascending sort order by default.
  You can however capitalize each keyword to reverse its order (i.e.
  Highscore would sort high scoring articles first, which is usually
  what you expect).

  When comparing two articles, slrn steps through this list, starting
  with the first keyword, until it finds an entry for which the articles
  differ.

  You may want to use different criteria for sorting initial articles of
  threads than for "siblings" inside of threads. This is possible by
  using the delimiter '|': The comma-separated list before this
  delimiter is applied when sorting initial articles in threads; the
  string after the delimiter specifies the sort order to be used inside
  threads. For example, if you want to see high scoring and recent
  threads first, but sort the messages within the thread from oldest to
  newest, you could set custom_sort_order to Highscore,Date|date.

  There is no performance penalty when using custom sorting. Actually,
  the other sorting methods are merely there for convenience and use the
  same algorithm internally. As an example, here is a list of those
  settings for custom_sort_order that are equivalent to the ``sorting
  methods'':

          0 and  1  ""
          2 and  3  "Highscore,subject"
          4 and  5  "Score"
          6 and  7  "Score,subject"
          8 and  9  "Highscore,Date"
          0 and 11  "Highscore,date"

  6.17.  decode_directory

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  The directory where uuencoded files, shar archives and things like
  that are placed after decoding. This variable has no effect if slrn is
  built without support for decoding articles (i.e. if SLRN_HAS_DECODE
  in slrnfeat.h is disabled at compile time; default on VMS). If
  decode_directory is unset, ``save_directory'' is used.

  6.18.  display_cursor_bar

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, the "cursor" will be displayed as a horizontal bar across
  the screen rather than an arrow ("->") in the first column.

  6.19.  drop_bogus_groups

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  When a group is removed from the server, slrn will automatically drop
  it from your newsrc file, which is generally what you want to do in
  this situation. However, some broken servers make groups appear as if
  they were removed, requiring their users to re-subscribe manually when
  they become available again. If your server is affected, you can set
  this variable to zero.

  6.20.  editor_command

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  The value of this variable is used as a shell command to start your
  favourite editor. However, slrn will prefer the more specific
  variables - there is one for each case in which an editor is needed:

     Posting an article or a followup:
        slrn uses ``post_editor_command''

     Replying by mail:
        slrn uses ``mail_editor_command''

     Editing a score file:
        slrn uses ``score_editor_command''

  editor_command is a kind of fall-back if the more specific editor
  command is not set. If editor_command is empty, slrn looks at
  ``$SLRN_EDITOR'' et al.

  The following % escapes can be used:

          %s  name of the file to edit
          %d  number of the first line of the message body

  If no escapes are found, the filename is simply appended to the
  specified command.

  Example:

          set editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp"

  See also: ``charset editor''

  6.21.  editor_uses_mime_charset

  This variable is obsolete, use ``charset'' instead.

  6.22.  emphasized_text_mask

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  This variable controls what parts of an article should be scanned for
  emphasized text (like *this*, _this_ or /that/), which will then be
  processed according to the value of ``emphasized_text_mode''. It has a
  bitmapped value which can be the sum of any combination of the
  following numbers:

          1  scan message portion (the non-quoted, non-signature part)
          2  scan quoted text
          4  scan signature
          8  scan header lines

  For example, if you wanted slrn to look for emphasized text in both
  the message and the quoted portions, you would set this variable to 3
  (1+2).

  6.23.  emphasized_text_mode

  Type: integer
  Default: 3

  This variable controls how slrn displays text that has been recognized
  as emphasized. If it is non-zero, the text will be highlighted
  according to the color objects boldtext, italicstext and
  underlinetext.  Additionally, there are two values which have special
  meanings: If set to 1, the characters which were used for emphasis
  (`*', `/' and `_', respectively) are not printed on the screen; if set
  to 2, these characters are written as spaces. In all other cases
  (including the default value), they will not be changed.

  See also: ``emphasized_text_mask''

  6.24.  failed_posts_file

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  If posting failed for some reason, your article will be saved to the
  file specified by failed_posts_file.

  It this variable is unset, it defaults to the value of
  SLRN_FAILED_POST_FILE in slrnfeat.h, typically either "slrn-failed-
  post.txt" (UNIX and VMS) or "failpost.txt" (OS/2 and Windows).

  See also: ``save_posts''

  6.25.  fallback_charset

  Type: string
  Default: iso-8859-1
  Violating RFC recommendations, some broken newsreaders post unencoded
  8 bit characters in the headers or post non us-ascii characters in the
  body with a missing "Content-Type:" declaration. Setting this variable
  will help slrn to guess the correct encoding of the posting.

  Hint: It might be a good idea to set this variable to "Windows-1252"
  if you read Western or to "iso-8859-2" if you read Eastern European
  newgroups.

  Note: There is no need to set this variable to "utf-8"; slrn will
  always try "utf-8" first.

  6.26.  fold_headers

  This variable is obsolete.

  6.27.  followup_custom_headers

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Use this variable to create additional headers when posting a
  followup. You can use all % escapes that are defined in
  ``followup_string''. The headers you add this way will also show up in
  your editor and can be modified.

  Note: It is generally not possible to override existing headers using
  followup_custom_headers. See note at ``custom_headers'' for details.

  See also: ``reply_custom_headers'', ``supersedes_custom_headers''

  6.28.  followup_date_format

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable defines the format string for the "%D" specifier in
  ``followup_string''. Its syntax is identical to the one of
  strftime(3).

  If unset, slrn uses %Y-%m-%d (localized).

  See also: ``use_localtime''

  6.29.  followup_string

  Type: string
  Default: "On %D, %r <%f> wrote:" (localized)

  Each followup you write will automatically be prefixed by the value of
  followup_string. The following % sequences are recognized and replaced
  with the corresponding text that is extracted from the article you are
  answering:

          %s  Subject
          %m  Message-ID
          %r  Real name
          %R  Real name up to the first space (first name)
          %f  Email address
          %n  Current newsgroup
          %d  Date
          %D  Date (as defined by followup_date_format)
          %%  %

  Note: It is common practice to have at least the name of the person
  you are quoting in your followup_string.

  See also: ``followup_date_format'', ``reply_string''

  6.30.  followup_strip_signature

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, the signature is stripped automatically from the article
  you are answering when writing followups or replies. This is
  considered good netiquette whenever you do not want to refer to the
  signature in your reply.

  See also: ``ignore_signature'', ``hide_signature'',
  ``strip_sig_regexp''

  6.31.  followupto_string

  Type: string
  Default: "["Followup-To:" header set to %n.]" (localized)

  When you write a followup to a crossposting, slrn will ask you whether
  you want to set a "Followup-To:" header line (which is good netiquette
  in many cases). If you tell slrn to include the header at that point,
  it will also insert followupto_string as the first line of the body of
  your article to inform your readers about this.

  In this variable, you can use the same percent escapes as in
  ``followup_string''.

  6.32.  force_authentication

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If this variable is set to ``0'', slrn sends authentication data only
  if the server requests it. Although this conforms to RFC 2980, in
  practice you need to volunteer authentication to some servers, so the
  default setting is ``1'' whenever a username and password are
  specified with the nnrpaccess command. Usually, changing this setting
  from the default will produce undesirable results, such as being able
  to read but not post, or seeing only a limited number of newsgroups.

  Note: If you need to set this variable on a per-server basis, use a
  startup_hook():

  Example:

  ______________________________________________________________________
   define startup_hook()
   {
   !if (strcmp (server_name(), "send-no-password.com"))
   set_integer_variable("force_authentication", 0);
   }
  ______________________________________________________________________

  See also: ``nnrpaccess''

  6.33.  generate_date_header

  Type: integer
  Default: 0
  Usually, the generation of "Date:" header lines can be left to the
  server.  If it does not do this correctly, please complain to its
  administrator, as a working system clock is essential for a news
  server.

  That being said, you can still have slrn generate that header line
  itself by changing this variable; you might want to use this to make
  postings sent via slrnpull reflect the time they were written.
  However, please note that this might lead to articles being rejected
  if your system clock does not work correctly or an outgoing post was
  left in the queue for a long time.

  6.34.  generate_email_from

  Type: integer
  Default: (system dependent)

  If non-zero, a "From:" header line is generated when sending email. On
  Unix systems, this is usually not necessary, because the MTA will do
  the job for you and might even be configured to reject messages that
  already have a "From:" header.

  This variable defaults to 0, except on Windows and OS/2, where this
  feature is turned on by default. Its value cannot be changed when
  SLRN_HAS_STRICT_FROM was enabled at compile time (default is off).

  6.35.  generate_message_id

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, slrn creates its own "Message-ID:" header lines
  (consisting of the string "slrn", time, process id, user- and
  hostname) when posting. Setting this variable has no effect if
  creation of Message-IDs has been disabled at compile time.

  Note: Although creating your own Message-IDs has a lot of advantages,
  you should only allow slrn to do so if the hostname of the machine it
  is running on is a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) or you can
  provide a unique hostname. Otherwise, you cannot guarantee that your
  Message-IDs are unique and should leave the job to your news server.
  Also consider turning on ``use_recommended_msg_id''.

  See also: ``posting_host'', ``username''

  6.36.  group_help_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This string is displayed in the bottom line of the group menu. It is
  intended as a quick help. If unset, the following line is used
  (localized):

  SPC:Select  p:Post  c:CatchUp  l:List  q:Quit  ^R:Redraw (u)s:(Un)Subscribe

  See also: ``art_help_line'', ``header_help_line''

  6.37.  group_status_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable affects the status line in group mode. It accepts all %
  escapes that are defined for ``group_display_format'' plus the
  following ones:

          D  Prints `*' if newsrc file needs saving, `-' otherwise
          L  Current line (e.g. "1/34")
          P  Percentage of the way through the group window
          s  Name of the current server

  When unset, slrn takes -%D-News Groups: %s %-20g -- %L (%P)
  (localized) as the default.

  See also: ``art_status_line'', ``header_status_line'',
  ``top_status_line''

  6.38.  grouplens_host

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  If you intend to use GroupLens, this variable has to contain the name
  of the server that carries the GroupLens scores.

  This variable does not have an effect if GroupLens support is
  disabled; see ``use_grouplens'' for details.

  See also: ``grouplens_port'', ``grouplens_pseudoname''

  6.39.  grouplens_port

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  This variable contains the port you want slrn to use when connecting
  to ``grouplens_host''.

  See also: ``grouplens_pseudoname'', ``use_grouplens''

  6.40.  grouplens_pseudoname

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable is for your registered GroupLens pseudoname.

  See also: ``grouplens_host'', ``grouplens_port'', ``use_grouplens''

  6.41.  header_help_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This string is displayed in the bottom line in article mode when no
  article is shown (e.g. while you are just browsing through the
  headers). If unset, the following line is used (localized):

  SPC:Select  Ctrl-D:PgDn  Ctrl-U:PgUp  d:Mark-as-Read  n:Next  p:Prev  q:Quit

  See also: ``art_help_line'', ``group_help_line''

  6.42.  header_status_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  You can use this variable to customize the status line of the header
  window.  Here is a list of valid % escapes:

          L  Current line (e.g. "1/74")
          P  Percentage of the way through the header list
          T  Number of articles in the current subthread
          h  Number of high scoring articles in the group
          k  Number of articles killed by the scorefile
          l  Number of low scoring articles
          n  Name of the current group
          p  Prints `<' if the window is panned (scrolled horizontally)
          r  Number of read articles in the group
          t  Total number of articles in the group
          u  Number of unread articles in the group

  The special descriptors "%g" and "%?" work like in
  ``header_display_format''.

  When unset, the default is (the localized form of)
  "%p[%u/%t unread] Group: %n%-20g -- %L (%P)".

  See also: ``art_status_line'', ``group_status_line'',
  ``top_status_line''

  6.43.  hide_pgpsignature

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, PGP signatures in articles will not be displayed. The
  setting of this variable can be changed using ``toggle_pgpsignature''
  (default binding: `]') while slrn is running.

  See also: ``hide_signature''

  6.44.  hide_quotes

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  This variable can be used to hide quoted text. If it is non-zero,
  quoted text from the nth level on is hidden in the article pager
  (where n is the value of hide_quotes).

  To toggle the value at runtime, you can use the ``toggle_quotes''
  command.

  6.45.  hide_signature

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, signatures in articles (as defined by
  ``strip_sig_regexp'') will not be displayed. The setting of this
  variable can be changed using ``toggle_signature'' (default binding:
  `\') while slrn is running.

  See also: ``followup_strip_signature'', ``hide_pgpsignature'',
  ``ignore_signature''
  6.46.  hide_verbatim_marks

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If ``process_verbatim_marks'' is turned on, you can hide "verbatim
  marks" (#v+ and #v-) in the article body by setting this variable to a
  non-zero value. It can also be changed using ``toggle_verbatim_marks''
  while slrn is running.

  6.47.  hide_verbatim_text

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If ``process_verbatim_marks'' is turned on, you can hide text marked
  as "verbatim" by setting this variable to a non-zero value. It can
  also be changed using ``toggle_verbatim_text'' while slrn is running.

  See also: ``hide_verbatim_marks''

  6.48.  highlight_unread_subjects

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, the subjects of unread articles are highlighted. There
  are two possible ways of doing this:

  When set to one, unread subjects are printed bright (when using
  colors) or bold (in monochrome mode). This will obviously not have any
  visible effect if the subject is printed bold or in a bright color
  anyways. Besides that, the special color "default" does not have a
  bright version.

  When set to two, unread subjects are printed in the color you set with
  ``unread_subject''. In this case, only subjects of unread articles can
  be ``colored by score''.

  6.49.  highlight_urls

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, URLs are highlighted in the article pager using the
  ``url'' color object. This affects all portions of the message that
  are scanned for emphasized text.

  Note: When mouse reporting is enabled, highlighted URLs are also
  "clickable"; if you use the left or right mouse key, slrn will prompt
  you for changes to the URL before launching the browser.

  See also: ``emphasized_text_mask'', ``mouse''

  6.50.  hostname

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  hostname is used as the domain part of the email address slrn puts in
  your "From:" header, so it should be set to just that. This may or may
  not be the hostname of the machine slrn is running on, depending on
  whether you have an email account on that machine and whether you want
  to use it for your usenet postings.

  Please see the entry ``$HOSTNAME'' for a discussion of slrn's default
  behaviour if this variable is unset.

  Note: In each case, slrn either uses the information you set in
  ``posting_host'' or returned by gethostbyname(3) to generate its
  Message-IDs, so their domain part is not influenced by the value of
  this variable.

  See also: ``realname'', ``username''

  6.51.  ignore_signature

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If you use ``article_page_down'' (default binding: space) to read an
  article "page by page", you might find it annoying if the last page
  contains nothing but the author's signature. If you set this variable
  to a non-zero value, slrn will not scroll down in those cases, but
  immediately goes to the next article instead.

  See also: ``hide_signature'', ``strip_sig_regexp''

  6.52.  inews_program

  Type: string
  Default: (compile time setting)

  To post your articles, you can use an external program (usually
  inews(1)) instead of the builtin NNTP routines slrn offers (see
  ``post_object'' for details). In this case, inews_program can be used
  to specify the command you want slrn to pipe outgoing articles to.

  Note: This variable will not work if SLRN_HAS_USER_INEWS in slrnfeat.h
  was disabled at compile time. Obviously, it also has no effect if
  inews support is not compiled in.

  6.53.  invalid_header_score

  Type: integer
  Default: -1000

  This value will be applied as the initial score if the article has
  invalid headers.

  6.54.  kill_score

  Type: integer
  Default: -9999

  When the score of an article is equal or less than kill_score points,
  it will be killed. This means that it will not be displayed in article
  mode at all, so you won't be bothered with it.

  See also:  ``max_low_score'', ``min_high_score''

  6.55.  lines_per_update

  Type: integer
  Default: 50

  When entering a group or reading an article, slrn displays a
  "percentage meter" in the bottom line, telling the user how many
  articles (or lines) have already been read. This variable controls how
  often this message is updated (default is to update it every 50 read
  articles / lines).  You may want to change this value, depending on
  the speed of your server connection and of your display.

  Note: If you set this variable to less than 5, slrn will ignore it and
  use the default of 50 instead (or 20, when reading short articles that
  contain less than 200 lines).

  6.56.  macro_directory

  Type: string
  Default: (compile time setting)

  This variable specifies (in a comma separated list) paths to
  additional directories where you wish to keep your S-Lang macros.
  These paths may be absolute (beginning with "/") or relative to $HOME
  (or $SLRNHOME if set), and tell slrn where to look when loading macros
  with the ``interpret'' command.

  In Unix, the configure script automatically sets the default of this
  variable to the directory where the macros that come with slrn are
  installed. If it was called without any parameters, this is
  /usr/local/share/slrn/slang. If a macro does not exist in a path
  listed in macro_directory, slrn will first try to find it in $HOME (or
  $SLRNHOME), then in the compile-time default directory.

  Example:

          interpret "News/macros/my-macro.sl"
          interpret "/usr/share/slrn/slang/util.sl"

  can be replaced with

          set macro_directory "News/macros,/usr/share/slrn/slang"
          interpret "my-macro.sl"
          interpret "util.sl"

  6.57.  mail_editor_command

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable is interpreted as a shell command which will be used to
  invoke your editor of choice when you want to reply by email. If it is
  unset, slrn will use the editor defined by ``editor_command''.

  Note: The variable may contain % escapes. A list of them can be found
  in the section on ``editor_command''.

  See also: ``post_editor_command'', ``score_editor_command''

  6.58.  mail_editor_is_mua

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  Set this variable if your ``mail_editor_command'' is a Mail User
  Agent, i.e.  sends the email itself. This makes sure it does not get
  sent twice (both by your MUA and slrn).

  Example (using mutt as an external mailer):

          set mail_editor_command "mutt -H '%s'"
          set mail_editor_is_mua 1

  6.59.  max_low_score

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  Articles with a score lower than max_low_score will automatically be
  marked as read and receive the "HEADER_LOW_SCORE" header flag.
  However, they are still displayed in the header overview.

  See also: ``kill_score'', ``min_high_score''

  6.60.  max_queued_groups

  Type: integer
  Default: 20

  To reduce startup time, slrn sends the initial GROUP commands needed
  to find the number of unread messages in each group in batches (by
  default, 20 at a time). However, there are (few) servers which do not
  seem to like this - in those cases, slrn hangs at startup. If you
  experience this, try setting max_queued_groups to 1.

  Note: If you set this variable to 0 (or lower), it will switch back to
  1 automatically.

  6.61.  metamail_command

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  When you select an article which uses a MIME content type or encoding
  not supported by slrn, an external program can be launched to view it.
  This variable contains the name of the program which will be used in
  those cases. slrn will write the article to a temporary file, so the
  command used here has to accept a filename as its argument.

  If this variable is unset, slrn will try to invoke metamail. Setting
  this variable has no effect if MIME support has not been compiled in.

  See also: ``use_metamail''

  6.62.  mime_charset

  This variable is obsolete, use ``charset'' instead.

  6.63.  min_high_score

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  Articles with a score of at least min_high_score points are marked as
  "high" (the "HEADER_HIGH_SCORE" header flag is set; this is indicated
  in header overview by an exclamation mark). Articles with "high"
  scores are displayed first in sorting modes 2-11 and you will be able
  to jump to the next "high scoring" article using ``next_high_score''
  (default binding: `!').

  See also: ``kill_score'', ``max_low_score'', ``sorting_method''

  6.64.  mouse

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If this variable is non-zero and you run slrn inside an xterm
  compatible X terminal emulation program, some basic mouse support will
  be activated. The following table lists what you can do with the
  mouse:

  In group mode:

          Object              Button  Action
          ---------------------------------------
          Top Status line     any     specified by button label
          Group Name          any     select group
          Bottom Status line  middle  toggle display of unread groups
          Bottom Status line  left    page-down
          Bottom Status line  right   page-up

  In article mode:

          Object                 Button      Action
          ---------------------------------------------
          Top status line        any         specified by button label

          Header status line     left        header page down
                                 right       header page up
                                 middle      hide article window

          Article status line    left        next unread
                                 right       previous unread
                                 middle      toggle quotes

          Header item            any         select item

          Article window         left        article page down
                                 right       article page up
                                 middle      hide article window
          URL in article window  left/right  confirm and browse URL
                                 middle      browse URL

  Note: Setting this variable to -1 will always activate mouse support,
  even if it does not work (and is therefore useless) on the current
  terminal.

  6.65.  netiquette_warnings

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  When non-zero, slrn will warn you if your posting does not conform to
  some generally accepted netiquette guidelines. You can still force the
  posting, so it's probably a good idea to keep this turned on to make
  sure that you do not violate these rules without noticing it.

  Note: Currently, this feature warns you when crossposting to more than
  four groups or without setting a "Followup-To:", or if the "Followup-
  To:" header line contains multiple groups. Additionally, you are
  notified if your signature has more than four lines.

  See also: ``reject_long_lines''

  6.66.  new_subject_breaks_threads

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  In large threads, the tree built by looking at the "References:" can
  become quite complex and sometimes confusing. Thus, some people prefer
  to see a separate thread tree whenever the "Subject:" header line
  changes. Set this variable to 1 if you want this (more, but smaller
  trees).

  By default, slrn puts articles with identical subjects into the same
  thread, even if they are not linked by a "References:" header. If you
  want slrn to thread based on references only, set this variable to 2
  (also gives you more, but smaller trees). If you want to enable both
  of these features, use 3 as the value.

  Note: Before comparing subjects, a leading "Re: " and a trailing
  "(was: ...)" is cut off. However, the regular expressions in
  ``strip_re_regexp'' and ``strip_was_regexp'' are not used.

  6.67.  no_autosave

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  By default, slrn creates an autosave copy of your newsrc file (ending
  in ".as") whenever you leave a group. Thus, you won't lose (much) data
  if slrn (or the system it runs on) should go down hard.

  If you set this variable to 1, this feature is turned off. If you set
  it to 2, slrn will autosave to the newsrc file itself (not to a
  temporary file).

  See also: ``no_backups''

  6.68.  no_backups

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, no backups of the newsrc file are created.

  See also: ``no_autosave''

  6.69.  non_Xbrowser

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  The command in this variable will be used to start a text mode web
  browser when ``browse_url'' (default binding: `U') is called. slrn
  will chose the text mode web browser if ``$DISPLAY'' is unset or no
  command could be found in ``Xbrowser''.

  6.70.  organization

  Type: string
  Default: (compile time setting)

  Using this variable, you can set the "Organization:" header line to an
  arbitrary string. A discussion on how slrn obtains the default value
  can be found in the entry on ``$ORGANIZATION''.

  6.71.  overview_date_format

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable defines the format string for the "%D" specifier in
  ``header_display_format''.  Its syntax is identical to the one of
  strftime(3).

  If unset, slrn uses "%d %b %y %H:%M".

  See also: ``use_localtime''

  6.72.  post_editor_command

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable is interpreted as a shell command which will be used to
  invoke your editor of choice when you edit a new posting or write a
  followup. If it is unset, slrn will use the editor defined by
  ``editor_command''.

  Note: The variable may contain % escapes. You will find a list of them
  in the section on ``editor_command''.

  See also: ``mail_editor_command'', ``score_editor_command''

  6.73.  post_object

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Controls the method slrn uses to post articles. It can be one of
  "nntp" (use builtin NNTP support), "inews" (pipe article to an
  external program) or "slrnpull" (spool messages for slrnpull to send).
  If the variable is unset, the default depends on the compile time
  setting of SLRN_DEFAULT_POST_OBJ in slrnfeat.h.

  See also: ``server_object'', ``use_slrnpull''

  6.74.  postpone_directory

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Directory where articles you want to postpone are saved. If this
  variable is unset, slrn will try to use "News/postponed" for this
  purpose.

  6.75.  prefer_head

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  This variable affects "expensive scoring": If available, slrn uses the
  XOVER and XHDR extensions to retrieve only the needed header lines;
  otherwise, the HEAD NNTP command is used to get all headers. Although
  this notably increases network traffic, it might be faster, depending
  on your connection and the number of "expensive" headers you score on.
  In this case, you can set this variable and slrn will prefer HEAD over
  XOVER / XHDR.

  When set to 2, slrn never tries to use XOVER. This is only useful for
  servers with broken XOVER implementations.

  6.76.  printer_name

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable can be used to customize the ``print'' function. Its
  meaning and the default action depend on the operating system:
  On Unix systems, it can contain a command to which slrn will pipe the
  article you want to print. For example, you would set it to
  "my_print_filter | lpr -Pmy_printer" if you want the article to be
  processed by my_print_filter and then printed on "my_printer". If
  unset, the default action is to use lpr with the value of ``$PRINTER''
  as the -P option.

  On Windows98, you can set this variable to the name of the print queue
  you want to use. Here, the default is to use the setting in "win.ini".

  On Windows XP, you have to share your attached printer and assign a
  "share name". The printer_name string has to be set to this "share
  name".

  print is not yet implemented for VMS.

  6.77.  process_verbatim_marks

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If this variable is set to a non-zero value, slrn will interpret text
  enclosed by "#v+" and "#v-" (on a line of their own) as "verbatim".
  Verbatim text will be displayed according to the color object
  verbatim; emphasized text it might contain will not be highlighted.
  This is especially useful when dealing with source code.

  Note: slrn is currently the only program that interprets these
  verbatim marks. This is due to the lack of a standard that would
  describe a way to mark text as "verbatim" in usenet articles.

  See also: ``emphasized_text_mask'', ``emphasized_text_mode'',
  ``hide_verbatim_marks''

  6.78.  query_next_article

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  When you use ``article_page_down'' (default binding: space) while you
  are already at the end of an article, slrn moves to the next unread
  article. If this variable is set to 0, this will happen automatically;
  if it is 1, you will be asked to confirm that you want to select the
  new article.

  See also: ``query_next_group''

  6.79.  query_next_group

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  When you use ``article_page_down'' (default binding: space) while you
  are at the end of the last unread article in a group, slrn can move to
  the next newsgroup that contains unread articles. If this variable is
  set to 0, this will happen automatically; if it is 1, you will be
  asked to confirm that you want to select a new group.

  See also: ``query_next_article''

  6.80.  query_read_group_cutoff

  Type: integer
  Default: 100

  When you enter a newsgroup and slrn is about to read more than
  query_read_group_cutoff article headers, it will prompt you to confirm
  (or change) the number of articles to read. This feature is turned off
  if you set this variable to 0.

  Setting this variable to a negative number -n has a similar effect.
  However, slrn will not prompt you in this case; instead, it will
  automatically download n articles if more are present.

  6.81.  quote_string

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This string will be used to indent quoted text in followups and
  replies.  If the variable is unset, slrn uses ">".

  Note: slrn's default is the only quote prefix commonly accepted on
  Usenet. Please do not change it unless you are posting to a group or
  network that follows different rules.

  See Also: ``smart_quote''

  6.82.  read_active

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If this variable is non-zero, slrn will read the active file from the
  server when starting. If your server carries few groups or your
  network connection is fast (e.g. because you are using a local
  newsserver), this may lead to a faster startup. If it is slow, you
  should leave the default setting untouched.

  6.83.  realname

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  It is considered good netiquette to set this variable to your real
  name. It will be included in the "From:" header line. If you do not
  set it, slrn tries to get a value from ``$NAME''. On UNIX systems, it
  also queries the /etc/passwd gecos field.

  See also: ``hostname'', ``username''

  6.84.  reject_long_lines

  Type: integer
  Default: 2

  If set to 1, slrn will not allow you to post articles containing non-
  quoted lines which are longer than 80 characters. If you set it to 2,
  slrn will merely issue a warning that you can decide to ignore (e.g.
  when posting source code). Setting this variable to 0 turns the check
  off. Please note that long lines are generally considered bad
  netiquette.

  See also: ``netiquette_warnings''

  6.85.  reply_custom_headers

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Use this variable to create additional headers when replying to a
  posting (via email). You can use all % escapes that are defined in
  ``followup_string''. The headers you add this way will also show up in
  your editor and can be modified.

  Note: It is not possible to override existing headers using
  reply_custom_headers.

  See also:  ``custom_headers'', ``followup_custom_headers'',
  ``supersedes_custom_headers''

  6.86.  reply_string

  Type: string
  Default: "In %n, you wrote:" (localized)

  This variable determines the attribution line slrn uses when replying
  via email. You can use the same % escapes as in ``followup_string''.

  6.87.  replyto

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  You can use this variable to set the address you want replies to your
  articles to be sent to. You only need to set this if you do not want
  people to send replies to the address in the "From:" header line. If
  you do not set this variable, slrn tries to get a default value from
  ``$REPLYTO''.

  See also: ``hostname'', ``username''

  6.88.  save_directory

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Sets the default directory where saved articles are placed. If it is
  unset, slrn uses "News".

  Note: If save_directory is not an absolute pathname, it is interpreted
  as being relative to your home directory as determined by the
  environment variables ``$SLRNHOME'' or ``$HOME''.

  See also:  ``decode_directory'', ``postpone_directory''

  6.89.  save_posts

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Specifies a file to which every article you post should be appended
  (in standard mailbox format). If unset, slrn will not even try to make
  a copy of your postings; if it cannot write to the specified file, it
  will give a warning and post nonetheless.

  Note: If the filename in save_posts does not contain an absolute path,
  it is interpreted as being relative to your home directory (see
  ``$SLRNHOME'').

  Hint: If you get error messages when using this variable, you possibly
  pointed it to a directory instead of a file.

  See also:  ``save_replies''

  6.90.  save_replies

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Specifies a file to which every reply you send by email should be
  appended (in standard mailbox format). The same rules apply as for
  ``save_posts''.

  Note: If you send a Cc (carbon copy) of one of your articles by email,
  the posting will only be appended to the folder in save_posts, not to
  save_replies.

  6.91.  score_editor_command

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Defines the program that will be called to edit your score file. If
  unset, the editor in ``editor_command'' is used.

  Note: The variable may contain % escapes. They are listed in the
  section on ``editor_command''.

  See also: ``mail_editor_command'', ``post_editor_command''

  6.92.  scorefile

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  If you want to score articles, you need to set this variable to the
  filename of your scorefile. It is interpreted as being relative to
  your home directory (unless it starts with a slash), or relative to
  $SLRNHOME if this is set.

  If you want to use more than one scorefile, you need to use an include
  statement in the scorefile itself. Please do not confuse this with the
  ``include'' slrnrc command discussed above.

  For further details on scoring, please refer to the file score.txt
  that should have come with your slrn distribution. The FAQ also
  answers questions about scoring and includes some examples. A future
  version of this manual might also include a separate section about the
  concept of "scoring".

  6.93.  scroll_by_page

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If set to non-zero, both group window and header window will scroll by
  a full page instead of a single line. This does not affect the article
  window, as it has separate commands for scrolling by ``lines'' and by
  ``full pages''.

  Note: If you change this variable at runtime, the change will take
  effect as soon as you select a group or enter group mode.

  6.94.  sendmail_command

  Type: string
  Default: (compile time setting)

  slrn uses this string as a command to send email (when forwarding or
  replying). Input will be piped to the program if the system supports
  it.  On systems without pipes, sendmail_command will be given the name
  of a temporary file containing the email as the last command line
  argument.

  The default is set at compile time. On Unix, the configure script
  tries to find the sendmail binary; otherwise, you can set
  SLRN_SENDMAIL_COMMAND in slrnfeat.h.

  Hint: Some sendmail replacements for Windows expect the input to be
  piped to the program, what slrn is not able to do. You can handle this
  by adding a "<" at the end of the string.

  6.95.  server_object

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Controls the method slrn uses to read news. It can be either "nntp"
  (connect an NNTP server) or "spool" (read from a local spool).

  If this variable is unset, the default behaviour depends on the
  compile time #define SLRN_DEFAULT_SERVER_OBJ in slrnfeat.h. If NNTP
  support is compiled in, it is used by default.

  See also: ``post_object'', ``use_slrnpull''

  6.96.  show_article

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, the first article is automatically displayed when
  entering a group.

  6.97.  show_thread_subject

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  When viewing a thread tree, slrn usually does not display subjects
  that are identical to the one of the previous posting as this would
  make the screen look busy without giving any additional information.
  If you still prefer to have all subject lines displayed, you can set
  this variable to a non-zero value.

  6.98.  signature

  Type: string
  Default: (compile time setting)

  slrn can append a signature to all outgoing articles and mails.  Set
  signature to the name of your signature file or to an empty string if
  you don't want to use a signature. slrn will not give any error
  message if the file specified in signature does not exist.

  The default of this variable is defined in slrnfeat.h
  (SLRN_SIGNATURE_FILE): It is ".signature" on Unix and VMS and
  "signatur.txt" on OS/2 and Windows.

  If the signature contains non us-ascii characters make sure they have
  the same encoding defined in ``charset editor''

  Note: If your signature file doesn't start with sig dashes ("-- \n"),
  slrn will add them automatically.

  See also: ``signoff_string''

  6.99.  signoff_string

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  The value of this variable will be inserted before the signature. This
  is useful for people who want to sign off their messages with their
  name, like it is common in some groups.

  Note: If you use this feature, do not append much more than your name
  with it, or you will annoy your readers. If you want to tell people
  the URL of your homepage or append some funny quote to your postings,
  put it in your ``signature file''.

  6.100.  simulate_graphic_chars

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If you see strange characters in the thread tree, you can set this
  variable to a non-zero value to make slrn restrict itself to the use
  of simple ASCII characters to represent the thread tree. slrn does
  this automatically if you use OS/2 or Windows and your system does not
  have line drawing characters.

  Note: It also might be possible to fix your terminal to support proper
  line drawing (which looks much better). Please see the slrn FAQ for
  details.

  6.101.  smart_quote

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  slrn can be told to insert a blank between your ``quote_string'' and
  previously unquoted lines, leading to a result most people find better
  readable. This variable controls the way slrn formats quotes:

          1  Insert whitespace before previously unquoted lines
          2  Do not quote blank lines
          3  Do not quote blank lines, but insert a whitespace before others

  6.102.  sorting_method

  Type: integer
  Default: 3

  This variable controls in which order articles will be displayed in
  the header window:

           0  do not sort
           1  perform threading
           2  sort by subject
           3  thread, then sort by subject
           4  sort by score
           5  thread, then sort by score
           6  sort by score, then by subject
           7  thread, then sort by score and subject
           8  sort by date with most recent first
           9  thread, then sort by date with most recent first
          10  sort by date with most recent last
          11  thread, then sort by date with most recent last
          12  custom sorting

  As all the options offered by sorting_method can be replaced with a
  corresponding setting for custom sorting, this variable will be
  removed at some point in the future.

  To learn more about the powerful options in custom sorting, please
  look at the variables ``custom_sort_order'' and
  ``custom_sort_by_threads''.

  6.103.  spoiler_char

  Type: character
  Default: '*'

  This character will be used to hide "spoiler" text (i.e. text preceded
  by a formfeed character). The interpretation of formfeed characters as
  "spoilers" can be turned off at compile time with:

          ./configure --disable-spoilers

  See also: ``spoiler_display_mode''

  6.104.  spoiler_display_mode

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  This variable defines what happens when a spoiler is revealed (this is
  typically done by hitting space, which is the default binding of
  ``article_page_down''):

          0  keep the display still, and reveal the current spoiler
          1  start a new page, and reveal the current spoiler
          2  keep the display still, and reveal all spoilers
          3  start new page, and reveal all spoilers

  See also: ``spoiler_char''

  6.105.  spool_active_file

  Type: string
  Default: "data/active"

  Sets the location of the active file that lists all available
  newsgroups.  The filename is relative to ``spool_inn_root'', unless it
  starts with a slash ('/').

  The default of this variable is set at compile time in slrnfeat.h
  (#define SLRN_SPOOL_ACTIVE).

  Note: Of course, you only need to set the spool* variables if you want
  to read your news directly from spool (e.g. when using slrnpull). When
  using an NNTP server, setting them will have no effect.

  See also: ``spool_inn_root'', ``server_object'', ``post_object'',
  ``use_slrnpull''

  6.106.  spool_activetimes_file

  Type: string
  Default: "data/active.times"

  This variable provides the name of your news server's active.times
  file.  This file contains the creation dates of the newsgroups.

  The notes that can be found in the entry for ``spool_active_file''
  also apply to this variable.

  See also: ``spool_inn_root''

  6.107.  spool_check_up_on_nov

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, slrn checks whether the articles referenced by the news
  overview files actually exist. This may add a perceptible delay and is
  redundant with servers that keep their overview files up to date.
  However, some servers don't, so if you see a lot of "article not
  available" errors, you might want to turn this on.

  Note: Setting this option also allows slrn to find out the article
  size if it's not in the overview file,

  See also: ``spool_active_file'', ``spool_nov_file''

  6.108.  spool_inn_root

  Type: string
  Default: "/var/lib/news"

  The directory that contains the active, active.times and newsgroups
  files.

  The default of this variable is set at compile time in slrnfeat.h
  (#define SLRN_SPOOL_INNROOT).

  See also: ``spool_active_file'', ``spool_activetimes_file'',
  ``spool_newsgroups_file''

  6.109.  spool_newsgroups_file

  Type: string
  Default: "data/newsgroups"

  This variable provides the name of your news server's newsgroups file.
  The file contains a list of newsgroups with short descriptions
  (taglines).

  The notes that can be found in the entry for ``spool_active_file''
  also apply to this variable.

  See also: ``spool_inn_root''

  6.110.  spool_nov_file

  Type: string
  Default: ".overview"

  The name of your news server's overview files.

  See also: ``spool_nov_root''

  6.111.  spool_nov_root

  Type: string
  Default: "/var/spool/news"

  The root directory of the news overview database. Often, this is the
  same as ``spool_root''.

  See also: ``spool_nov_file''

  6.112.  spool_overview_file

  Type: string
  Default: "data/overview.fmt"

  This variable provides the name of your news server's overview.fmt
  file, which describes the format of the overview files.

  The notes that can be found in the entry for ``spool_active_file''
  also apply to this variable.

  See also: ``spool_inn_root''

  6.113.  spool_root

  Type: string
  Default: "/var/spool/news"

  The root directory of your news spool.

  See also: ``spool_inn_root'', ``spool_nov_root''

  6.114.  supersedes_custom_headers

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  This variable is used to create additional headers when superseding a
  message. Otherwise, it works exactly like ``followup_custom_headers''.

  See also: ``custom_headers'', ``reply_custom_headers''

  6.115.  top_status_line

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Using this variable, you can customize the status line slrn displays
  at the top of the screen. It can be set to a format string that works
  like the one used in ``header_display_format''. The following %
  escapes can be used:

          %  percent character
          d  current date
          n  name of the current newsgroup
          s  name of the current server
          t  current time
          v  version of slrn

  The special sequences `%g' and `%?' work as described in
  ``header_display_format''.

  When unset, slrn uses "slrn %v ** Press '?' for help, 'q' to quit. **
  Server: %s" (localized) as the default.

  Note: The current time and date are printed in the preferred
  representation for the current locale. If you have date/time
  information in the status line, you should be aware that it is not
  automatically redrawn every second.

  6.116.  uncollapse_threads

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, all threads will be uncollapsed when entering a group.

  6.117.  unsubscribe_new_groups

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, new newsgroups won't be subscribed automatically.

  6.118.  use_blink

  Type: integer
  Default: (system dependent)

  Enables blinking of display if non-zero. The default is 0 if your
  terminal supports colors, 1 if not.

  Note: If you run a color terminal and find that setting this variable
  to 1 makes it possible to use bright colors for the background, please
  look into using a different terminfo entry. See section ``color'' for
  details.

  6.119.  use_color

  Type: integer
  Default: (system dependent)

  Forces the use of colors (if set to 1) or the use of monochrom mode
  (if set to 0). When unset, color is automatically used if your
  terminal supports it according to its termcap entry.

  6.120.  use_flow_control

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If set to non-zero, ^S/^Q processing by the terminal driver is
  enabled. This means that you will be able to "freeze" the screen using
  Control-S and "thaw" it by pressing Control-Q.

  6.121.  use_grouplens

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, slrn will try to contact your ``grouplens server'' to
  exchange GroupLens scores.

  This variable has no effect if GroupLens has not been enabled at
  compile time.

  Note: As far as we could find out, GroupLens is not in use any more.
  If this is incorrect, we would be grateful for a pointer to additional
  information on it.

  6.122.  use_header_numbers

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, header numbers are displayed at the left margin to make
  article selection more efficient.

  6.123.  use_localtime

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  This variable determines if your local timezone is used by the "%D"
  specifiers in ``followup_date_format'' and ``overview_date_format''.
  The following settings are possible:

          0  always use GMT
          1  use local timezone in overview_date_format
          2  use local timezone in followup_date_format
          3  always use local timezone

  Note: This setting does not affect the "Date:" header lines in your
  own postings. They are not even generated by slrn, unless you set
  ``generate_date_header''. VMS and BeOS do not support using GMT.

  6.124.  use_metamail

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, slrn calls the program given in ``metamail_command'' to
  processes MIME articles it cannot handle.

  6.125.  use_mime

  This variable is obsolete.

  6.126.  use_recommended_msg_id

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  When posting, some newsservers suggest a Message-ID to the client;
  that way, the client knows in advance which Message-ID the article
  will have and can save it for later reference. If this variable is
  set, slrn makes use of this: The server-proposed ID will be used for
  the posting and saved along with the article in the ``save_posts''
  folder.
  If both this variable and ``generate_message_id'' are set, slrn uses
  the server's ID rather than generating its own.

  6.127.  use_slrnpull

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, slrn will spool outgoing postings to let slrnpull send
  them instead of contacting the newsserver itself. The same effect can
  be achieved by setting ``post_object'' to "slrnpull".

  See also: ``server_object''

  6.128.  use_tilde

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  If non-zero, tildes ("~") are displayed at the end of an article like
  it is done in the vi editor.

  6.129.  use_tmpdir

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If non-zero, temporary files for postings, followups and replies will
  be held in the directory specified by ``$TMP'' (the entry there also
  explains what will happen if $TMP is unset), and Randomized filenames
  will be used for posts instead of .article, .followup and .letter.

  6.130.  use_uudeview

  Type: integer
  Default: (compile time setting)

  If your copy of slrn has support for external uudeview libraries
  (--with-uu), but you still want to use the (faster, but less
  sophisticated) builtin routines for decoding binary files, set this
  variable to 0. Otherwise, it has no effect.

  6.131.  username

  Type: string
  Default: (system specific)

  Contains your user name (login name). It is used as the local part of
  your email address and as a part of the Message-ID: header (if slrn is
  configured to create one).

  If it is unset, slrn tries to get your login name from the system
  first. If this fails, it looks at ``$USER'' and ``$LOGNAME''. If it
  cannot find a valid user name, an error message is issued and the
  program is aborted.

  Note: Do not confuse your user name with your real name!

  See also: ``hostname'', ``realname''

  6.132.  warn_followup_to

  Type: integer
  Default: 1

  When a "Followup-To:" header line is set, your followup will appear in
  different newsgroups than the original posting. If you always want to
  be notified of this, you can set this variable to 2. The default
  setting (1) only warns you when your followup would not appear in the
  group you are currently reading; setting it to 0 disables this warning
  completely.

  6.133.  wrap_flags

  Type: integer
  Default: 3

  This variable controls what text is wrapped in the article pager when
  pressing the ``wrap_article'' key (bound to "W" by default):

          0  wrap body only
          1  wrap headers and body
          2  wrap quoted material and body
          3  wrap headers, quoted material and body

  If you want to wrap long lines automatically, without having to press
  a key, you can set the variable to one of these values:

          4  wrap body only
          5  wrap headers and body
          6  wrap quoted material and body
          7  wrap headers, quoted material and body

  See also: ``wrap_method'', ``wrap_article''

  6.134.  wrap_method

  Type: integer
  Default: 2

  With this variable, you can control how slrn wraps long lines. When 0,
  it wraps at word boundries, leaving words that are longer than your
  line width untouched. When 1, it always wraps at the right border of
  the screen. When 2, it first tries so find a good place to wrap the
  line and wraps at the right border only when necessary.

  See also: ``wrap_flags''

  6.135.  write_newsrc_flags

  Type: integer
  Default: 0

  If this variable is zero, all groups are saved when writing your
  newsrc file. If it is 1, unsubscribed groups are not saved; if it is
  2, unsubscribed groups are not saved if there are any unread messages
  in them.

  6.136.  Xbrowser

  Type: string
  Default: (unset)

  Used to start an X11 web browser on a URL when ``browse_url'' (default
  binding: `U') is called. If ``$DISPLAY'' is set, slrn tries to execute
  the command stored in Xbrowser. Otherwise, non_Xbrowser is used
  instead. The string may contain "%s" which will be replaced with the
  chosen URL. If no such substring is found, the URL is simply appended
  to the specified command.

  Example:

          set Xbrowser "netscape %s &"

  See also: ``non_Xbrowser''

  7.  Interactive functions

  This section lists all functions with their compiled in bindings. Some
  functions accept a prefix argument; it can be set by pressing escape
  and a number before calling the function (e.g. to call
  ``select_group'' with the prefix argument four, you need to press "ESC
  4 ENTER".

  If you want, you can use the ``setkey'' configuration command to bind
  them to different keys. However, please note that the online help
  won't be updated automatically. If you want it to reflect your
  changes, you currently need to make use of the ``$SLRNHELP''
  environment variable and change ``art_help_line'' et al.

  Note: If a function is bound to an uppercase letter, you can call it
  without holding down shift as long as the corresponding lowercase
  letter is unbound (e.g. pressing `p' in group mode will post an
  article, although ``post'' is really bound to `P'). This does not work
  the other way round (e.g. pressing `M' will do nothing, as
  ``move_group'' is bound to `m' and `M' is unbound by default).

  7.1.  group functions

  The functions described here are available in group mode.

  7.1.1.  add_group

  Default: "a"

  Prompts for a newsgroup that gets added to your list. If the group is
  in your newsrc file, but was hidden or unsubscribed, it is shown.
  Otherwise, the server is queried - if the group exists, it is inserted
  after the current group. In any case, the cursor is moved to the
  group.

  7.1.2.  bob

  Default: "CTRL-K UP" "ESC <"

  Moves the cursor to the first newsgroup that is currently visible
  ("beginning of buffer").

  7.1.3.  catchup

  Default: "c"

  Marks the current group as read.

  7.1.4.  eob

  Default: "CTRL-K DOWN" "ESC >"

  Moves the cursor to the last newsgroup that is currently visible ("end
  of buffer").

  7.1.5.  evaluate_cmd

  Default: "CTRL-X ESC"

  Reads a line and interprets it as S-Lang.

  7.1.6.  group_search

  Default: "/"

  Old alias of ``group_search_forward''.

  7.1.7.  group_search_backward

  Default: "\"

  Works like ``group_search_forward'', but searches backwards.

  7.1.8.  group_search_forward

  Default: "/"

  Searches for a substring in group names and descriptions ("tag
  lines"), starting at the current cursor position and wrapping around
  the list if necessary. Hidden and unsubscribed groups are not taken
  into account.

  See also: ``group_search_backward''

  7.1.9.  help

  Default: "?"

  Displays the online help for group mode.

  7.1.10.  line_down

  Default: "DOWN" "N" "CTRL-N"

  Moves the cursor to the next visible group.

  7.1.11.  line_up

  Default: "UP" "CTRL-P"

  Moves the cursor to the previous visible group.

  7.1.12.  move_group

  Default: "m"

  Allows you to move the current newsgroup to another position. You can
  move it around using the keys bound to ``line_up'' and ``line_down''
  (the up and down arrow keys by default). When finished, press Return.

  It is probably a good idea to make all groups visible first, calling
  using ``toggle_hidden'' if necessary. When there are hidden groups,
  the current group is placed directly before the next visible group
  when moving it towards the top or directly after it when moving to the
  bottom, which may or may not be where you really wanted it to be.

  7.1.13.  page_down

  Default: "PAGEDN" "CTRL-D" "CTRL-V"

  Scrolls down one page.

  7.1.14.  page_up

  Default: "PAGEUP" "CTRL-U" "ESC V"

  Scrolls up one page.

  7.1.15.  post

  Default: "P"

  Post an article. The default is to post to the current newsgroup. If
  no newsgroup or no subject is specified, slrn does not even invoke the
  editor.

  7.1.16.  post_postponed

  Default: "ESC P"

  Lets you chose an article from the ``postpone directory'' to re-edit,
  post or delete it.

  7.1.17.  quit

  Default: "q" "CTRL-X CTRL-C"

  Quits slrn.

  7.1.18.  redraw

  Default: "CTRL-R" "CTRL-L"

  Redraws the screen. This should only be necessary when another program
  wrote to stdout directly.

  7.1.19.  refresh_groups

  Default: "G"

  Queries server for new articles; unless display of all groups was
  turned on with ``toggle_list_all'', groups without unread messages are
  hidden. This function also checks for new groups if
  ``check_new_groups'' is on.

  7.1.20.  repeat_last_key

  Default: "."

  Repeats the last keystroke.

  7.1.21.  save_newsrc

  Default: "X"

  Updates your newsrc file. It contains information about the groups you
  are subscribed to, the order in which they should be displayed and
  what articles you marked as read. This file is automatically written
  when ``quitting'' slrn.

  7.1.22.  select_group

  Default: "RETURN" "SPACE"

  Enters the current group for reading. When using a prefix argument,
  this function also downloads previously read articles:
          1  Select group with article number query.
          2  Select group, but do not apply scores.
          3  Select group with query, but do not apply scores.
          4  Select group.

  7.1.23.  subscribe

  Default: "s"

  Subscribe to the current newsgroup. If used with a prefix argument,
  slrn will prompt you for a regular expression and subscribe to all
  groups matching it.

  7.1.24.  suspend

  Default: "CTRL-Z"

  Suspends slrn (if allowed by your shell).

  7.1.25.  toggle_group_formats

  Default: "ESC A"

  Toggles between the different ``group display formats''. You can chose
  a particular format by specifying a prefix argument (e.g. the function
  selects the second display format when called with two as the prefix
  argument).

  7.1.26.  toggle_hidden

  Default: "l"

  If some groups are hidden because they contain no unread articles,
  this function makes them visible and vice versa; however, this
  function does not toggle the display of unsubscribed groups (see
  ``toggle_list_all'' for this).

  7.1.27.  toggle_list_all

  Default: "L"

  This function prompts for a wildmat expression and displays all groups
  that match it (querying the server if necessary). If your server does
  not support the "LIST ACTIVE" NNTP command with a wildmat argument and
  ``read_active'' is off, only groups from your newsrc file are taken
  into account; in that case, you might not find this feature very
  useful.

  When calling toggle_list_all the second time, the unsubscribed groups
  are hidden again. You can also hide the unsubscribed groups by using
  this function with the prefix argument one or show all unsubscribed
  groups with the prefix argument two (does not query the server).

  7.1.28.  toggle_scoring

  Default: "K"

  Toggles between slrn's scoring types:

          Full    Use "expensive" (full header) scoring which may be slow.
          Simple  Score based on XOVER data only (faster).
          None    Turn off scoring.
          Cancel  Keep current setting.

  7.1.29.  transpose_groups

  Default: "CTRL-X CTRL-T"

  Transpose the position of the current group with the one above it in
  the list. If there are hidden groups between them, they remain
  untouched. If you want to rearrange your group list, you'll probably
  find the ``move_group'' function more convenient.

  7.1.30.  uncatchup

  Default: "ESC u"

  Marks all articles in the current group as unread.

  7.1.31.  unsubscribe

  Default: "u"

  Unsubscribe the current group. If used with a prefix argument, slrn
  will ask you for a regular expression and unsubscribe all groups that
  match it. Information about read articles in unsubscribed groups is
  kept.

  7.2.  article functions

  These functions can be used in article mode, i.e. after selecting a
  group and downloading its headers.

  7.2.1.  article_bob

  Default: "<"

  Shows the first page ("beginning of buffer") of the current article.

  7.2.2.  article_eob

  Default: ">"

  Shows the last page ("end of buffer") of the current article.

  7.2.3.  article_left

  Default: "LEFT"

  Pans the article window back to the left (after using
  ``article_right'').

  7.2.4.  article_line_down

  Default: "ESC DOWN" "RETURN"

  Scrolls the article down one line.

  7.2.5.  article_line_up

  Default: "ESC DOWN"

  Scrolls the article up one line.

  7.2.6.  article_page_down

  Default: "SPACE"

  Scrolls the article down one page.

  If a spoiler is visible, this function reveals it. How exactly this is
  done depends on the setting of ``spoiler_display_mode''.

  If you are already at the end of the article, slrn goes to the next
  article (when reading from an slrnpull spool, headers for which no
  article bodies are present get skipped). If there is no next unread
  article in the group, it goes to the next group. If there is no next
  group with unread headers, it returns to the group screen. Whether or
  not you are prompted first in these cases depends on the settings of
  ``query_next_article'' and ``query_next_group''.

  7.2.7.  article_page_up

  Default: "b" "DELETE"

  Scrolls the article up one page.

  7.2.8.  article_right

  Default: "RIGHT"

  Pan the article window to the right. This is useful if the article
  contains long lines and wrapping is turned off.

  See also: ``wrap_flags'', ``wrap_article''

  7.2.9.  article_search

  Default: "/"

  Searches for a given substring in the current article, starting at the
  cursor position.

  7.2.10.  author_search_backward

  Default: "A"

  Like ``author_search_forward'', but searching backwards, starting at
  the cursor.

  7.2.11.  author_search_forward

  Default: "a"

  Searches the "From:" header lines in the current group for a given
  substring, starting at the cursor position.

  7.2.12.  browse_url

  Default: "U"

  Searches for URLs in the current article and displays them in a menu.
  If you select one of them, slrn starts your browser on it. An exeption
  to this are "nntp:" URLs - slrn handles those itself by trying to
  fetch the referenced article or switching to the given newsgroup.

  See also: ``non_Xbrowser'', ``Xbrowser''

  7.2.13.  cancel

  Default: "ESC CTRL-C"

  Cancels the current article (i.e. sends a request to delete it to your
  server). slrn only allows you to cancel articles you wrote yourself.
  Please note that due to abuse of cancel messages, some servers are
  configured to ignore them.
  7.2.14.  catchup

  Default: "C" "ESC C"

  Marks all articles up to the currently selected one as read.

  7.2.15.  catchup_all

  Default: "c" "ESC c"

  Marks all articles in the current group as read.

  7.2.16.  create_score

  Default: "K"

  Interactively creates a score file entry based on data from the
  currently selected article. If this function is called with a prefix
  argument, it opens the score file for manual editing.

  See also: ``score_editor_command''

  7.2.17.  decode

  Default: ":"

  This function decodes files that are included in articles using the UU
  or base64 encoding. You first need to specify a temporary file to
  which the articles that should be decoded are saved. Then, the actual
  decoding takes place; the resulting files are put in the directory
  given in ``decode_directory''. When finished, slrn will ask you
  whether you want to delete the temporary file, which is usually not
  needed any longer at this point.

  By placing the cursor on a collapsed thread, you can decode the files
  in all articles in it. Multipart binary postings can be decoded by
  using ``tag_header'' to tag all parts first (you need to do this in
  the correct order; slrn does not re-arrange the parts).

  7.2.18.  delete

  Default: "d"

  "Deletes" the current article (i.e. marks it as read) and proceeds to
  the next unread header. If the cursor is on a collapsed thread, all
  articles in it are marked as read.

  7.2.19.  delete_thread

  Default: "ESC d"

  Marks the current article and its subthread (all of its "children" in
  the thread tree) as read.

  7.2.20.  enlarge_article_window

  Default: "^"

  Enlarges the article window one row.

  See also: ``shrink_article_window''

  7.2.21.  evaluate_cmd

  Default: "CTRL-X ESC"

  Reads a line and interprets it as S-Lang. Identical with
  ``evaluate_cmd'' in group mode.

  7.2.22.  exchange_mark

  Default: ","

  Returns to the article previously marked using ``mark_spot''. Before
  that, the mark is moved to the current article, so you can jump back
  to it by calling exchange_mark again.

  7.2.23.  expunge

  Default: "x"

  Removes all articles from the list that are marked as read and not
  tagged as important (using ``toggle_header_tag'').

  7.2.24.  fast_quit

  Default: "Q"

  Quit slrn immediately (without returning to group mode first).

  7.2.25.  followup

  Default: "f"

  Write a followup on the current article. The following prefix
  arguments are accepted:

          1  Insert all headers.
          2  Insert all headers, but do not modify the article (no quoting,
             don't strip or attach signatures).

  7.2.26.  forward

  Default: "F"

  Forward (mail) the current article to someone. All headers are
  included when using the prefix argument ``1'', and the subject is
  prepended with ``Fwd:''.  If you wish, you can edit the e-mail before
  it is sent (to add a comment or cut down the article to the relevant
  part).

  7.2.27.  forward_digest

  Default: "g"

  This function can be used to skip to the next part in mailing list
  digests or to find the next section section in many FAQs. To do this,
  it first tries to find a line that starts with "Subject:" (followed by
  a blank or a tab); if no such line is present, it looks for a line
  that starts with a digit.

  7.2.28.  get_children_headers

  Default: "ESC CTRL-P"

  Reconstructs the current sub-thread (i.e. finds all children of the
  selected posting). Using a prefix argument makes this function less
  "thorough", which means that it is faster, but more likely to miss
  some articles.

  For those who are interested in the technical details of this:
  get_children_headers queries the server for articles that have the
  current Message-ID in the "References" header line. Unless a prefix
  argument is set, this is done recursively for each child. This often
  finds additional articles, as the current Message-ID might have been
  dropped from the "References" header when it became too long at some
  point.

  Note: This function depends on the "XPAT" NNTP extension, which is not
  supported by all servers. Even when it's supported, it will only find
  articles that were posted to the current group.

  7.2.29.  get_parent_header

  Default: "ESC p"

  Goes to the current article's parent, downloading it from the server
  if necessary. When used with a prefix argument, the whole thread is
  reconstructed; the prefix argument two makes this faster, but more
  likely to miss some articles (see ``get_children_headers'' for a
  discussion of this).

  7.2.30.  grouplens_rate_article

  Default: "0"

  Set a GroupLens rating for the current article.

  7.2.31.  goto_article

  Default: "j"

  Jumps to an article with a given header number. Here, "header number"
  refers to the number assigned to the article by the server, not the
  one which is by default shown at the left border of the header window.

  7.2.32.  goto_last_read

  Default: "L"

  Jumps to the last article you read.

  7.2.33.  header_bob

  Default: "ESC <"

  Goes to the first article in this group ("beginning of buffer").

  7.2.34.  header_eob

  Default: "ESC >"

  Goes to the last article in this group ("end of buffer").

  7.2.35.  header_line_down

  Default: "DOWN" "CTRL-N"

  Goes to the next visible article in this group.

  7.2.36.  header_line_up

  Default: "UP" "CTRL-P"

  Goes to the previous visible article in this group.

  7.2.37.  header_page_down

  Default: "PAGEDN" "CTRL-D" "CTRL-V"

  Scrolls the header window down one page.

  7.2.38.  header_page_up

  Default: "PAGEUP" "CTRL-U" "ESC V"

  Scrolls the header window up one page.

  7.2.39.  help

  Default: "?"

  Displays the online help for article mode.

  7.2.40.  hide_article

  Default: "H"

  Hides the article pager (or shows it, if it was hidden).

  7.2.41.  locate_article

  Default: "ESC l"

  Locates an article by its Message-ID, downloading it from the server
  if necessary.

  7.2.42.  mark_spot

  Default: ";"

  Marks the current article. This makes it possible to come back to it
  later using ``exchange_mark''.

  7.2.43.  next

  Default: "n"

  Goes to the next unread article, uncollapsing threads if necessary.
  When reading from an slrnpull spool, headers for which the article
  body is not present get skipped. If the group does not contain a next
  unread header, slrn skips to the next group. Whether this happens
  automatically or you are prompted first depends on the setting of
  ``query_next_group''.

  7.2.44.  next_high_score

  Default: "!"

  Goes to the next article with a ``high score''.

  7.2.45.  next_same_subject

  Default: "="

  Goes to the next article that has the same subject as the currently
  selected article.

  7.2.46.  pipe

  Default: "|"

  Pipes the current article to a program.

  7.2.47.  post

  Default: "P"

  Posts an article. This function is identical with ``post'' in group
  mode.

  7.2.48.  post_postponed

  Default: "ESC P"

  Post a postponed article. Identical with ``post_postponed'' in group
  mode.

  7.2.49.  previous

  Default: "p"

  Goes to the previous unread article, uncollapsing thread if necessary.
  When reading from an slrnpull spool, headers for which the article
  body is not present get skipped.

  7.2.50.  print

  Default: "y"

  Sends the selected article to a printer. See ``printer_name'' for a
  discussion of how exactly this function prints the article and how it
  can be customized.

  When used with a prefix argument, the article is printed unwrapped and
  including all hidden lines (e.g. header lines or signatures that are
  not displayed in the article pager).

  7.2.51.  quit

  Default: "q"

  Returns to group mode.

  7.2.52.  redraw

  Default: "CTRL-L" "CTRL-R"

  Redraws the screen. Identical with ``redraw'' in group mode.

  7.2.53.  repeat_last_key

  Default: "."

  Repeats the last keystroke.

  7.2.54.  reply

  Default: "r"

  Reply to the selected article via email.

  7.2.55.  request

  Default: "m"

  If only the header of an article has been fetched, this command will
  mark its body for download the next time slrnpull is run; if the body
  was already marked for download, it gets unrequested.

  When you use this function on a collapsed thread, it will work on all
  postings inside it that do not yet have a body. If some of them are
  already marked for download, but some others are not, it does not
  toggle the state of each individual article, but requests all bodies.

  7.2.56.  save

  Default: "o"

  Saves the current article to a file (in mbox format). If the cursor is
  on a collapsed thread or you used ``tag_header'' to tag articles, you
  are prompted whether you want to save the whole thread or all tagged
  articles, respectively.

  The default filename is the name of the current group in the directory
  specified by ``save_directory''.

  7.2.57.  show_spoilers

  Default: "ESC ?"

  Reveals the next spoiler (i.e. all currently hidden text up to the
  next formfeed character). When used with a prefix argument, all
  spoilers are revealed. This function can be customized using
  ``spoiler_display_mode''.

  7.2.58.  shrink_article_window

  Default: "CTRL-^"

  Shrinks the article window one row.

  See also: ``enlarge_article_window''

  7.2.59.  skip_quotes

  Default: "TAB"

  Skips quoted text. What slrn regards as quoted text is determined by
  ``ignore_quotes''.

  7.2.60.  skip_to_next_group

  Default: "N" "ESC RIGHT"

  Goes to the next group that contains unread articles. If there is no
  such group, this function returns to group mode.

  7.2.61.  skip_to_previous_group

  Default: "ESC LEFT"

  Goes to the previous group that contains unread articles, returning to
  group mode if no such group exists.

  7.2.62.  subject_search_backward

  Default: "S"

  Like ``subject_search_forward'', but searching backwards.

  7.2.63.  subject_search_forward

  Default: "s"

  Searches the subjects in the current group for a given substring,
  beginning at the cursor.

  7.2.64.  supersede

  Default: "ESC CTRL-S"

  Supersedes the current article, i.e. allows you to re-edit it and
  sends it to the server along with a request to replace the original
  version with it.  Like with ``cancel'', this is not honored by some
  servers due to abuse of this feature and only allowed by slrn if you
  are the author of the current article.

  7.2.65.  suspend

  Default: "CTRL-Z"

  Suspends slrn (if allowed by your shell).

  7.2.66.  tag_header

  Default: "#"

  Attaches a numerical tag to the current header and moves the cursor
  down one line. If the header is already tagged, the tag is removed.
  When applied on a collapsed thread, all articles in it are tagged (or
  untagged, respectively). Numerical tags are useful to ``save'' or
  ``decode'' multiple messages.

  7.2.67.  toggle_collapse_threads

  Default: "ESC t"

  (Un-)Collapses the current thread, depending on its current status.
  When used with a prefix argument, all threads are (un-)collapsed.

  7.2.68.  toggle_header_formats

  Default: "ESC a"

  Toggles between different ``header display formats''. You can pick a
  particular format by specifying a prefix argument (e.g. the function
  selects the second display format when called with two as the prefix
  argument).

  7.2.69.  toggle_header_tag

  Default: "*"

  Marks the current article unread, flags it as important (or removes
  the flag, if the article already had one) and moves the cursor to the
  next line.  This flag prevents articles from being marked as read
  (both explicitly and by ``catchup'' functions). Using this function
  with a prefix argument removes the flags from all headers.

  Note: By default, these flags are not "persistent" - as soon as you
  leave the group, they are gone. However, the macro set stickytags.sl
  can be used to change this and even preserve them between sessions.

  7.2.70.  toggle_headers

  Default: "t"

  Toggles between the display of all or just the article headers
  selected in ``visible_headers''.

  7.2.71.  toggle_pgpsignature

  Default: "]"

  Toggles the variable ``hide_pgpsignature'' that controls the display
  of PGP signatures.

  7.2.72.  toggle_quotes

  Default: "T"

  Toggles the display of quoted text as recognized using
  ``ignore_quotes''. When n is set as a prefix arguments, the first n
  quote levels remain untouched.

  This function also sets the value of ``hide_quotes'' to match the new
  state. This means that if the quotes get shown again, it is set to 0;
  if a prefix argument is given, it is set to prefix argument + 1;
  otherwise, it is restored to the value it got when you last used a
  prefix argument (or, if you never did this, to 1).

  7.2.73.  toggle_rot13

  Default: "ESC R"

  ROT13-decode article. Calling this function a second time undoes the
  effect.

  7.2.74.  toggle_signature

  Default: "\"

  Toggles the variable ``hide_signature'' which controls the display of
  signatures.

  7.2.75.  toggle_sort

  Default: "ESC S"

  Displays a menu that allows you to change the value of
  ``sorting_method'' which controls the threading / sorting method.

  7.2.76.  toggle_verbatim_marks

  Default: "["

  Toggles the variable ``hide_verbatim_marks'', which controls the
  display of "verbatim marks".

  7.2.77.  toggle_verbatim_text

  Default: "{"

  Toggles the variable ``hide_verbatim_text'', which controls the
  display of text marked as "verbatim".

  7.2.78.  uncatchup

  Default: "ESC U"

  Marks all articles from the top of the header window up to the current
  article as unread.

  7.2.79.  uncatchup_all

  Default: "ESC u"

  Marks all headers in the current buffer as unread. If you want a
  command that affects all available articles (i.e. not only the ones
  you downloaded when entering the group), use ``uncatchup'' in group
  mode.

  7.2.80.  undelete

  Default: "u"

  Marks the current article (or all articles in a collapsed thread) as
  unread and moves the cursor to the next line.

  7.2.81.  untag_headers

  Default: "ESC #"

  Removes all numerical tags that were previously set using
  ``tag_headers''.

  7.2.82.  view_scores

  Default: "v"

  Brings up a selection box that lists all scorefile entries that match
  on the current article. The available information is: Scoring value of
  the entry, name of the entry (this field is optional; please see
  score.txt on how to assign names), name of the scorefile and line
  number.

  If you select an entry, your editor will be started on the scorefile.
  If the editor supports it and you have a "%d" escape in your
  ``score_editor_command'', the cursor is moved to the selected entry,
  which makes this function especially useful for finding and fixing
  "broken" scorefile entries.

  See also: ``create_score''

  7.2.83.  wrap_article

  Default: "W"

  Toggles the wrapping of long lines.

  See also: ``wrap_method''

  7.2.84.  zoom_article_window

  Default: "z"

  Maximizes the article pager (or unmaximizes it, if it already takes up
  the whole screen).

  7.3.  readline functions

  These functions can be used while entering data in slrn's readline
  interface, i.e. at a prompt at the bottom of the screen.

  7.3.1.  bdel

  Default: "BACKSPACE"

  Deletes the character before the cursor.

  7.3.2.  bol

  Default: "HOME" "CTRL-A"

  Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

  7.3.3.  complete

  Default: "TAB"

  When prompting for a filename, this function tries to complete the
  content of the line (up to the current position of the cursor) to the
  name of a file or directory. If multiple completions are possible, it
  will only insert the portion of the name that is common to all of
  them. In that case, calling the function again will give you a list of
  possible completions to chose from.

  On all other prompts, it works like ``self_insert''.

  7.3.4.  cycle

  Default: "SPACE"

  This function works like ``complete'', except that it cycles between
  all possible completions rather than inserting the largest common
  portion.

  When no completions are found, this command works like
  ``self_insert''; if you need a literal space character although a
  completion exists, use ``quoted_insert''.

  7.3.5.  del

  Default: "DELETE" "CTRL-D" "CTRL-V"

  Deletes the character under the cursor.

  7.3.6.  delbol

  Default: "CTRL-U"

  position.

  Deletes everything from the beginning of the word to the cursor
  position.

  7.3.8.  deleol

  Default: "CTRL-K" "CTRL-L"

  Deletes everything from the cursor position to the end of the line.

  7.3.9.  down

  Default: "DOWN" "CTRL-N"

  Jumps to the next (later) command line history entry.

  7.3.10.  enter

  Default: "RETURN"

  Finishes the editing, returning the current content of the line to the
  program.

  function.

  Default: "RIGHT" "CTRL-F"

  Moves the cursor to the right.

  7.3.15.  self_insert

  Default: any key not bound to another function
