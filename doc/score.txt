  1.  An introduction to scoring

  1.1.  General description of scoring

  slrn awards an article points by giving it a score. If the score for
  the article is less than max_low_score (zero by default), the article
  is marked as read. If the score is less than or equal to kill_score
  (-9999 by default), the article is killed. If the score is greater
  than or equal to min_high_score (1 by default), the article is marked
  as important. The purpose of the score file is to define the set of
  tests that an article must go through to determine the score.

  Although the score may be based on ANY header item, it is recommended
  that one stick with the information found in the news overview data
  when scoring in slrn (slrnpull gets full headers anyways, so it does
  not make a difference there). The news overview file typically
  contains:

          * Subject
          * From
          * Date
          * Message-ID
          * References
          * Bytes
          * Lines

  plus any header that your news admin decided to include here (usually,
  `Xref' is one of them). slrn offers two special keywords that also
  allow efficient scoring: `Newsgroup' (the newsgroup that the article
  is part of) and `Age' (the age of the article in days).

  1.2.  Location of the scorefile

  The location of the scorefile is specified with the scorefile
  configuration variable. E.g.,

          set scorefile "scores/default.score"

  Note: The file must be created before it can be used.

  Tip: Using the ``.score'' filename suffix may enable appropriate
  syntax highlighting in some editors, such as vim.

  1.3.  Editing the scorefile

  The scorefile may be edited while slrn isn't running, or from within
  slrn with the create_score interactive function in article mode. By
  default, this function is bound to the ``K'' key. Using ``K'' alone
  gives an interactive choice of popular scoring options. To edit the
  scorefile with a text editor use a prefix argument (``ESC 1 K'');
  you'll be presented with a commented-out scorefile entry for editing.

  Tip: When learning scoring, reading the commented-out lines that slrn
  adds to the scorefile when creating scores interactively is likely to
  be as helpful as reading documentation.

  2.  An explanation of the scorefile format

  The format of the file is very simple (See below for an explicit
  example).  The file is divided into sections delimited by a newsgroup
  or newsgroups enclosed in square brackets, e.g.,

          [rec.crafts.*, rec.hobbies.*]

  The name may contain the `*' wild card character.

  Comments begin with the `%' character. Leading whitespace is ignored.

  Each section consists of comment lines, empty lines or keyword lines.
  Only the keyword lines are meaningful and all leading whitespace is
  ignored. A keyword line begins with the name of the keyword followed
  immediately by one or two colons and one space. The rest of the line
  usually consists of a regular expression. The keyword may be prefixed
  by the `~' character to signify that the regular expression should not
  match the object specified by the keyword.

  Documentation on the slang regular expressions format can be found at
  <http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/doc/html/slang.html>.

  A group of keywords defines a test that is given to the header of the
  article.  The `Score' keyword is used to assign a score to the header.
  If it is followed by a single colon, the score is only given if all
  tests are passed (logical AND); two colons indicate that the score
  should be awarded if any of the tests are passed (logical OR). The
  score can be any positive or negative integer. If the numerical value
  of the score is prefixed by an equals sign, score processing for the
  header is stopped and the header will be given the score for that
  test.

  Note: The `Score' keyword also serves to delimit tests. You can
  optionally add a comment behind the score, which will then be used as
  the name of the scorefile entry and displayed when using view_scores
  (`v') in article mode. Here is an example of this:

          Score: 100 % optional name here

  All keywords except for `Score' and `Expires' may be prefixed by the
  `~' character. If the `Expires' keyword appears, it must immediately
  follow the `Score' keyword. The `Expires' keyword may be used to
  indicate that the test is no longer to be applied on the date
  specified by the keyword. For example,

          Expires: 4/1/2010              (or: 1-4-2010)

  implies that the given test is no longer valid on or after April first
  2010.  As the example indicates, the date must be specified using
  either the format MM/DD/YYYY or DD-MM-YYYY. Note: DO NOT CONFUSE THIS
  WITH THE EXPIRES HEADER KEYWORD.

  The `Lines', `Bytes', `Age' and `Has-Body' keywords are also special.
  Their value is not a regular expression, rather, a simple integer.

  `Lines' and `Bytes' may be used to kill articles which contain too
  many or too few lines / bytes. For example,

          Score: -100
          Bytes: 20480

  assigns a score of -100 to articles that are larger than 20 kB. Please
  keep in mind that `Bytes:' is only available when getting overview
  data and will otherwise (e.g. in slrnpull) be set to 0.

  Similarly, the test

          Score: -100
          ~Lines: 3

  assigns a score to articles that have less than or equal to 3 lines.

  `Age' can be used to score articles which are younger than N days. For
  example:

          Score: 10
          Age: 7

  adds 10 points to the score of each article that is at most one week
  old. You can use negation (`~') to score articles that are older than
  N days.

  `Has-Body' can be used when reading offline in combination with
  slrnpull: You can tell slrnpull to download only article headers by
  default and fetch article bodies on request. In this case, you can use
  a rule like

          Score: 20
          Has-Body: 1

  to give each article that does have a body 20 points. You can invert
  this (i.e. score articles without bodies) either by using negation
  (`~') or by writing `Has-Body: 0'. Values other than 0 or 1 have no
  meaning.

  Finally a score file may include other score files via the `include'
  statement. The syntax is simple:

          include FILE

  The name of the file is considered to be relative to the directory of
  the file including it, unless an absolute path is specified. For
  instance, suppose `/home/john/News/Score' contains

          include /usr/local/share/slrn/score
          include score_spam

  and `/usr/local/share/slrn/score' contains the line:

          include score_spam

  In the first instance, `score_spam' will be read from the directory
  `/home/john/News' but in the second instance it will be read from
  `/usr/local/share/slrn'.

  3.  A sample slrn score file

  [news.software.readers]
          Score: =1000
          % All slrn articles are good
          Subject: slrn

          Score: 1000
          % This is someone I want to hear from
          From: davis@space\.mit\.edu

          Score: -9999
          Subject: \<agent\>

  [comp.os.linux.*]
          Score: -10
          Expires: 1/1/2010
          Subject: swap

          Score: 20
          Subject: SunOS

          Score: 50
          From: Linus

          % Kill all articles cross posted to an advocacy group
          Score: -9999
          Xref: advocacy
          ~From: Linus

          % This person I want nothing to do with unless he posts about
          % `gizmos' but only in comp.os.linux.development.*
          Score: -9999
          From: someone@who\.knows\.where
          ~Subject: gizmo
          ~Newsgroup: development

  [~misc.invest.*, misc.taxes]
          Score:: -9999
          Subject: Earn Money
          Subject: Earn \$

  4.  Explanatory notes for the sample scorefile

  This file consists of three sections. The first section defines a set
  of tests applied to the news.software.readers newsgroups. The second
  section applies to the comp.os.linux newsgroups. The final section
  applies to ALL newsgroups EXCEPT misc.invest.* and misc.taxes (see
  below).

  The first section consists of three tests. The first test applies a
  score of 1000 to any subject that contains the string `slrn'. The
  second test applies to the `From'. It says that any article from
  davis@space.mit.edu has its score increased by 1000. The third test
  reduces by -9999 the score of any article whose subject contains the
  word `agent'. Since tests are applied in order, if an article contains
  both `slrn' and `agent', it will be given a score of 1000 since the
  value is prefixed with an equal sign.

  The second section is more complex. It applies to the comp.os.linux
  newsgroups and consists of 5 tests. The first three are simple: -10
  points are given if the subject contains `swap', 20 if it contains
  `SunOS', and 50 if the article is from someone named `Linus'. This
  means that if Bill@Somewhere writes an article whose subject is `Swap,
  Swap, Swap', the article is given -10 points. However, if Linus writes
  an article with the same title, it is given -10 + 50 = 40 points. Note
  that the first test expires at the beginning of 2010.

  The fourth test kills all articles that were cross-posted to an
  advocacy newsgroup UNLESS they were posted by Linus. Note that if a
  keyword begins with the `~' character, the effect of the regular
  expression is reversed.

  The fifth test serves to filter out posts from someone@who.knows.where
  unless he posts about `gizmos' in one of the comp.os.development
  newsgroups. Again note the `~' character.

  The final section of the score file begins with the line

          [~ misc.invest.*, misc.taxes]

  If the first character following the opening square bracket is `~',
  then the newsgroup or newsgroups contained in the brackets are NOT to
  be matched.  That is, the `~' character is used to denote the boolean
  NOT operation.

  For writing even more complex entries, slrn now allows the grouping of
  scorefile rules. Here is a simple example:

          Score:: -1000
          ~Subject: \c[a-z]
          {:
                  Subject: ^Re:
                  ~Subject: ^Re:.*\c[a-z]
          }

  Lines enclosed in curly braces are grouped; the initial brace is
  followed by one or two colons that indicate whether only one (`::') or
  all of the lines (`:') inside the group need to match for the group to
  pass.

  As the result, the example kills subject header lines that do not
  contain lowercase characters, not counting an initial `Re:'.
